mr president-in-office of the council , you made reference to the spanish presidency in your introduction a moment ago .
i would , in turn , like to refer to the belgian presidency , for stockholm has given this belgian presidency a number of very essential and firm mandates .
first and foremost , it was given the mandate to formulate goals with a view to taking up the fight against poverty and social exclusion in concrete terms at european level .
this is a very important mandate in my view .
secondly , demographic development , to which you yourself have already referred .
in this framework , my group is , in fact , giving its unqualified support to the decision to start formulating concrete goals on employment for older employees .
however , mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , choices must be made in these areas too .
this brings me to my final point , mr president-in-office : the quality of work .
ladies and gentlemen , the quality of work , however , is not just a question of indicators and open coordination .
it is also a question of legislation .
these too will help guarantee the quality of work , and we are relying on the swedish and belgian presidencies to do their bit .
mr president , let me briefly comment on what has been said .
this means that we were well-placed to achieve success .
i will comment on the points you raised from two perspectives .
i want to talk firstly about foreign relations and secondly about the lisbon process , as my initial report was primarily structured in that way .
this is based on consensus , unanimity .
we are aware that not all of us within the union agree on every issue , but on this issue we are agreed .
when we are able to put forward common principles , we must naturally also act together .
naturally we attracted a great deal of attention in the media when we received president putin as a guest .
we have an obligation , we have a right , to take the initiative in our relations both with the united states and russia .
relations must be deepened and developed , and dialogue must be open .
it must be honest and it must be critical , but we must naturally , on the basis of our size and our strength , carry out this dialogue with very , very great self-confidence .
this is what this is about .
i am pleased that you realise that , during the swedish presidency , we are seeking to highlight joint action in foreign affairs also within the european union and within the framework of the council .
this is far from unimportant .
now , a few words on the lisbon process .
let me comment on the discussion on deregulation and liberalisation .
i am the prime minister of a country which has opened up many markets , which has liberalised and deregulated .
i primarily see positive effects of this , but i would be a very poor politician if i did not also recognise the difficulties in carrying out such a process .
this is a very large and fundamental reorganisation .
it is far from simple .
it is no easy debate .
i believe that it would be an incredibly great mistake to force through decisions and so create a situation where these fundamental changes in many countries would immediately lead to extremely strong national opposition .
therefore , i believe that the method we are using in the lisbon process is superior for this type of fundamental change in financial and political conditions .
i say this as a response to mr poettering of the conservative group , as i can see how the process will develop over time .
the process is heading in the right direction , and we are implementing it in such a way that we have the support of national political opinion in each country .
we can never ignore this .
we constantly have to maintain this balance .
here i am talking to those who said that we have not produced any initiatives to combat unemployment .
our work in this respect is characterised by the fact that unemployment is best combated by economic growth and economic development .
without increased production , we will have no opportunities to successfully combat unemployment .
we can create various programmes , reduce working hours , carry out a large number of different initiatives - but for those people who are most hard pressed , this will always be a defensive programme .
if we are to be proactive in addressing unemployment , we must do so by increasing the cake by developing the economy .
this is why we have drawn up guidelines in stockholm .
several speakers have mentioned enlargement of the union .
we are currently negotiating intensively with the active participation of the commission .
as far as i can judge , the negotiations are successful , but they are not easy .
this change must make their accession as painless and successful as possible .
these negotiations are difficult and we are in the middle of them .
i am hopeful that , in the negotiations in the spring during the swedish presidency , we shall achieve success that we will be able to describe as a breakthrough .
regarding openness , the presidency and parliament are in alliance .
i hope that we succeed .
i myself would agree with the criticism which bertel haarder makes of the situation .
i will be happy to talk about this question again in a bilateral context .
we all have an interest in this , whether we are participating in the currency union from the start or whether we will be joining later .
success , which is what we are seeking , is to the advantage of the entire european economy .
mr president , thank you once more for your many constructive contributions and points of view .
i would also like to thank the commission for working so well with us in the run-up to the stockholm summit .
mr president , i shall be very brief in my reply because it differs only slightly from what prime minister persson said .
having said that , i do acknowledge the objections raised and comments made by many members on the issue of decision-making processes , on the need for new decision-making processes .
this is a clear commitment made by parliament and all of us .
quite the contrary : it is possible to rectify the situation and combine globalisation and social justice .
this does not have to be the case at all .
furthermore , another point emerged as a common concern , linked to the forthcoming gothenburg summit , and that is the adoption of a unanimous position on the kyoto protocol .
this is certainly not an attack on the united states , merely awareness that we must act responsibly .
and , as europeans , we must have a general sense of responsibility towards all the citizens of the world .
i would like to end with one last point , which might appear minor but which i consider to be extremely important .
mrs randzio-plath has raised this issue and rightly so , and i would like to respond briefly right here before parliament , for it is extremely important .
indeed , parliament will be able to comment on the distinction between the essential elements and the technical provisions of the measures proposed by the commission .
clearly , this distinction must be established through the usual procedure for codecision between parliament and the council .
there it is : we have to decide on the basis of concrete legislative proposals within the framework of the codecision procedure .
this will be extremely important at the gothenburg council .
but if we do not learn to do this as well , all the decisions we take will have to be revised in the future .
mr president , it was not only courteous of the swedish prime minister to come here , but also rather courageous .
as so many speakers have said , on the economic front , stockholm was a great disappointment .
to coin a phrase , the liberalising talk is ' all spin and no delivery ' .
we are witnessing serious under-performance by standards which europe 's socialist leaders have set themselves .
it is all a far cry from the spirit of the single market when the centre right ran europe .
one of the major failures of the stockholm summit was in the foreign affairs field .
with the great events taking place in the world , it was as if the stockholm summit was ignoring them .
until 1997 , every year the european union did so .
now the socialists are failing , it is business as usual .
there is now no single independent media channel in russia .
this is a scandal .
this is our great neighbour to the east .
we must deal with it on a practical and political basis , but with frankness and determination .
god help us if the socialists had run europe during the cold war .
( loud applause from the right )
mr president , god help us if the conservatives ever run europe again .
i wish to concentrate on two issues which i know parliament considers to be of the utmost importance , namely the galileo project and the future of postal services .
with regard to galileo it is worth remembering that this programme was actually instigated by the council in march 1998 .
this commitment was emphasised by the cologne council and feira when it was stated that strategic decisions had to be taken by december 2000 .
but then , to be blunt , the council , no doubt under pressure from finance ministers , got cold feet .
we have a commitment from the main european companies in this sector .
earlier in the day mr poettering criticised the council for not giving a timetable for the liberalisation of postal services .
by an overwhelming majority it voted for a controlled , gradual liberalisation down to 150 000 with no end-date for liberalisation .
so when i read in the stockholm conclusions that the council wishes to work with parliament , i welcome this .
but i would remind the council that parliament 's position is clear , unambiguous and has been arrived at with a clear political consensus across political divides .
on post parliament does not have a problem . the council does .
president .
as it is time to proceed to the vote , the debate is suspended and will be resumed at 3 p.m.
i welcome the progress made thus far .
we shall now proceed to the votes .
vote
mr president , normally any corrigenda to the various language versions are announced before the vote commences .
i understand that corrections are needed to the spanish version .
is the bureau aware of this or not ?
if it is , i would be grateful if they could be announced .
according to my information , there is a point in the spanish version which has not been brought into line with the basic english version .
mr president , i want to reiterate that this proposal was negotiated in spanish and in english and that therefore the only thing mr pomés 's intervention is trying to do is generate confusion .
i maintain that the corresponding spanish translation of the english text is ' autoridades competentes ' , because that is the truth and that is what is correct .
in particular , i should like the translation of section 19 to be reviewed .
there may be problems in general , but particularly section 19 in spanish is totally different from the english original .
it is worth pointing out that many small farmers in portugal are prevented from receiving proper aid for not selling all of their produce .
these farmers should be able to use their produce for on-farm consumption , which would guarantee their right to aid , if , for example , they base their application on the income brackets of their farms .
trakatellis report ( a5-0104 / 2001 )
mr president , as the uk labour delegation spokesperson on health , i would like to give an explanation of vote on the trakatellis report .
however , i would like to make it clear that the proposal for the centre mentioned in the trakatellis report gives us great concern .
we feel that this proposal is ill-thought through , the cost implications ill-considered and the legal implications could possibly delay all that is good in this report .
as i said last night , and i will say again , health is an issue which connects with the citizen .
therefore , it is important that we get this proposal through as quickly as possible .
i look forward to the second reading .
mr president , as the elected representative of the pensioners ' party to this parliament , i was very happy to vote for the trakatellis report , a very important report .
i was worried about what i was going to say in my explanation of vote because i did not dream at all last night , and i was very heavy eyed when i woke up .
however , precisely because i was very tired , i closed my eyes a little while ago and had a vision .
i saw mrs trakatellis as if in a dream .
i therefore saw mrs trakatellis ' important report as the sole means of curing the diseases of all the citizens of europe .
congratulations mrs trakatellis !
we consider that questions concerning public health and health care must be determined at national and regional level .
we therefore do not wish to develop the work of the eu in the area into something which increasingly controls the actions of nations in more and more detail .
we consider that with an increased budget and the foundation of a new health coordination and monitoring centre , the trakatellis report is heading in such a direction .
we have therefore voted against the report .
the eu 's intentions in the particularly sensitive area of public health are clearly set out in the conclusions of the recent council summit in stockholm .
it is no accident that there is no mention or specification whatsoever of the state 's obligation in any area or for any aspect of these issues .
this strategy on the part of the åu makes health totally dependent on the laws of the market , cost considerations , profits and returns .
health systems are now seen as a drain on public funds - rather than an investment in human resources - which need to adhere to the terms of budgetary discipline .
the european parliament 's rapporteur takes the same line as the commission .
unfortunately , he then contradicts his good intentions by using his report to commend and back the eu 's aggressive , anti-grass roots policy in the public health sector .
we support the rapporteur 's action on this proposal , on two points .
this is not the case , however .
the amendments proposed to parliament , some of which are a step in the right direction , would not be enough , even if they were adopted , to make the policy recommended by the commission acceptable .
a valid health policy requires resources that the commission is refusing to provide itself with .
we have therefore abstained from voting on this report , though we have voted on certain proposals .
therapeutic and diagnostic measures must not be considered to be exclusively commercial and industrial activities .
it should be noted that this component of public health has been treated as a separate commercial area and is currently controlled by multinationals , which undermines national and regional interests .
we will not , therefore , be able to have a good public health programme until we change this situation ;
the programme avoids talking about factors for health in the workplace and for workers ' health .
parliament calls in its text for a " health coordination and monitoring centre " ( hcmc ) to be set up , operated and extended .
we vehemently rejected this because this is a matter for the member states .
the text adopted by parliament also contains no specification that the limited funds available should be used in a sensible and targeted manner .
stauner report ( a5-0112 / 2001 )
fatuzzo ( ppe-de ) .
( it ) mr president , i voted for the stauner report , although i would have liked to have been able to be more whole-hearted about it .
why is that ?
let us therefore verify whether this money is used to bring practical benefit to the european citizens .
blak report ( a5-0113 / 001 )
fatuzzo ( ppe-de ) .
( it ) mr president , i voted against the discharge to the commission for the 1999 financial year . why is that ?
because i hope that the commission will make much , much greater efforts .
but to do what ? to resolve the problems of pensioners and elderly people in europe .
and how ? in totally the opposite way to that which i regret to say is continuously advocated , not just by the commission , but also in this house and by the council .
naturally we have voted against giving any discharge to the european commission .
we disapprove of both past budgets and the future budget , and of the very function of a commission that is entirely in the service of industrial and financial groups .
our negative votes on individual points are merely a continuation of this general lack of confidence .
mr blak 's report contains many points of criticism with regard to the european union 's expenditure and the responsibility for this .
according to his recommendations , a great deal needs to change yet .
further to this justified criticism , the logical conclusion would be for parliament once again to vote against the discharge of the previous budget year .
voting against is parliament 's only means of exercising power in order to bring about change and to challenge the council 's and the commission 's arrogance .
i will not grant approval until these instances of fraud have been resolved , the perpetrators penalised and the money concerned paid back .
until such time , it is not wise to trust to the good intentions of the new european commission which took up office in the autumn of 1999 .
to my great surprise , the otherwise so critical rapporteur now proposes to grant approval . i do not share his view on this .
i voted against discharge for the following reasons : i welcome the explanation given to plenary by the commissioner for budgets on the fléchard case on 3 april 2001 .
however , this alone is not tantamount to a fresh start in the commission 's policy on dealing with cases of fraud .
there is no clear statement that the way in which the case was handled after january 1994 was illegal .
nor has there been any significant change in the commission 's inadequate information policy vis-à-vis parliament compared with the 1998 discharge .
this inadequate commission information policy is exacerbated by the framework agreement which only allows the rapporteur access to documents .
according to the rapporteur 's own information , this applies here .
van der laan report ( a5-0108 / 2001 )
fatuzzo ( ppe-de ) .
some people - and i will tell you who , the british conservatives in particular - are calling for the committee of the regions to be abolished .
i do not support them .
the national states have to decide to take a step backwards .
we cannot have everything : therefore , let us hear less of the national states , and more of the regions and more of europe .
seppänen report ( a5-0097 / 2001 )
fatuzzo ( ppe-de ) .
( it ) mr president , the seppänen report comments on the abolition of the ecsc .
rühle report ( a5-0109 / 2001 )
fatuzzo ( ppe-de ) .
( it ) mr president , i told you just now that i had dropped off for a moment .
well , i had a day-dream - as opposed to a real dream - on precisely the rühle report , which gives me the opportunity to explain why i voted for the motion .
i was gulliver-fatuzzo , a minuscule man , and i was surrounded by giants .
who were these giants ?
they were an african , an asian , a south american and a man from the bahamas : in other words , they were the inhabitants of the developing countries covered by this report .
you are the ones who need to develop , for we are already developed enough ! "
hermange report ( a5-0084 / 2001 )
fatuzzo ( ppe-de ) .
look , mr fatuzzo , i have succeeded in getting the european union to adopt the regulation which makes it possible for people with disabilities to move around within the union without losing their pensions . "
it was only a dream , mr president !
the effort to mask the class aspects of the problem is obvious .
how can a child with disabilities from a poor lower-class family and a child from a rich family have equal opportunities ?
the only good thing is that employers are subsidised for taking on people with disabilities .
that is why the meps of the communist party of greece will not be voting in favour of the report .
i congratulate my french conservative colleague , mme hermange , on her imaginative and constructive report .
conservatives in the uk have voted in favour .
we particularly applaud two firsts today - the appearance of the report in braille in three languages , and the use of sign language in the debate .
the epp / ed group is not just talking about the needs of the disabled : we are actually doing something positive about it .
we have a duty not just to pontificate about rights , but to actively encourage access to education , training , employment and opportunity .
we can go back over previous resolutions and reports from this house concerning people with disabilities .
however , the same basic barriers and problems still exist .
some member states and some ngos have valiantly brought forward innovative initiatives to remove the barriers and obstacles to equal opportunity for all .
however , some still see this as a specific sector rather than as a reflection of our society 's failure to give opportunity for all .
we should work towards ensuring that by 2003 , which is the european year for disabled persons , we have guaranteed that the majority of those barriers have been removed .
i warmly welcome mrs hermange 's report on a barrier-free europe for people with disabilities .
it is crucial that we in the european parliament support such important measures to improve equal opportunities for people with disabilities .
it also underlines the need to mainstream disability issues into all policies .
however , we have a desperate shortage of skilled workers in the it sector across the european union .
i strongly believe that those with disabilities will be indispensable in this sector .
the manpower is available , we just need to introduce effective training and ensure there is no discrimination in allocating the jobs .
the need is there , the manpower is there - we must seize the opportunity and respond to this challenge of a new economy .
i fully support measures to improve accessibility for people with disabilities in all areas of life ranging from employment to it .
it refers to the 1996 communication concerning equal opportunities for people with disabilities , recognising their rights , rather than regarding them as people in need of charity .
this is a fundamental change in attitude which should be emphasised .
the concept of people with disabilities includes all types of disability , whether physical , mental or sensory .
this is another important fundamental change .
the lack of statistics on this subject has been apparent since 1998 .
the report makes a useful point in emphasising that the initial barriers to people with disabilities arise mainly during childhood .
( intervention shortened pursuant to rule 137 of the rules of procedure )
that concludes voting time .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.12 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
outcome of the european council of 23 / 24 march 2001 in stockholm including the situation in the middle east ( continuation )
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the outcome of the european council of 23 / 24 march 2001 in stockholm including the situation in the middle east .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am really sorry that we did not manage to conclude the debate this morning , as a rounded overview depended on it .
i think that the stockholm summit set the wrong priorities .
too much social and education policy - matters which , according to the treaties on european union , are not its concern - and too little market liberalisation .
the liberalisation of the energy markets was blocked by my country and by france .
and all the while , stockholm was busy setting specifications for social and education policy !
it is unacceptable .
europe is putting the cart before the horse .
it needs to continue with its liberalisation policy so that the markets can develop in the consumers ' interest .
this also qualifies as consumer and social policy because more competition means cheaper prices .
as far as social and education policy per se are concerned , we should again abide strictly by the principle of subsidiarity and leave it to the member states to put flesh on the bones of these concepts .
europe is not culturally homogenous , nor should it become so .
therein lies our strength because , on the contrary , europe thrives on its diversity .
i think that europe should stop wasting its energy and should again focus on tasks which it is able to carry out .
the next council in gothenburg in june will give the heads of state or government an opportunity to do so .
i hope that they will make use of it for the good of europe .
mr president , at the beginning of this discussion , i was reminded by mr dupuis of the moral depths to which i had sunk with my report on russia .
i harbour no hard feelings towards him for saying that , and i remain faithful to this dual-track policy , also politically speaking .
with regard to the russian federation , it is , in my opinion , very judicious always to talk in no uncertain terms , even if this involves chechnya .
i believe that our russian colleagues respond better to tough talking than evasive behaviour .
with regard to the balkans , i am delighted that the serbian police had the courage to arrest milosevic .
i hope the sfor stabilisation force will pluck up the same courage to arrest karadzic , for now that belgrade has been able to take this step , we cannot afford to lag behind in bosnia .
the council must therefore exert pressure on all those who are responsible for sfor to arrest karadzic .
it is also clear that the serbian head of state cannot be treated differently from any other head of state in this respect , simply because his actions have been more evil .
i believe it is absolutely vital that he should be brought to the hague , and that serbia should certainly not form an exception in this respect .
as a result , adjustments to new developments in the technical sector can be made much more quickly than was the case in the past .
the heads of state or government decided that the european economic area should become the most modern and the most competitive economic area , and this calls for a modern legislative procedure .
if what has been thought up here later proves its worth , it can be applied in other areas during the technical legislative procedure , perhaps including agriculture .
so what exactly is the problem ?
the problem is that even technical implementation , i.e. even the regulations issued on this basis , often conceal problems for our citizens .
here policy must be able to intervene and pull these points back into the decision-making process of the policy .
mr president , i fully subscribe to the intervention by mr von wogau and i shall make some additional remarks .
the lamfalussy report is based on one sure fact : the legislative procedure we have is too slow and prevents us from shaping legislation to market needs in time .
what the lamfalussy report does not say is that the point where legislation on this matter normally gets bogged down is in the council .
therefore i think the telling-off was aimed at the wrong culprit .
in my opinion , the solution prescribed may generate a lack of confidence which , in the long term , will result in an even slower process than we have had until now .
what parliament is asking is that when a rule of enforcement goes too far in relation to general principles , it must not be seen as a mandatory rule but as an unlawful one .
we are not asking the commission to take our opinion into consideration ; if the rule goes too far , the rule is not a rule .
that is what the theory of the mandate says , which i learnt in roman law , or the theory of the delegation of powers , which i learnt in political law .
under these conditions we could find ourselves with a hypermarket with no political control , in which the nation states are subordinated to semi-political decisions made by economic agents that would move with absolute freedom around the union .
we had more or less the same discussion before the single european act , when fortunately mrs thatcher 's ideas did not triumph .
mr president , a decision with serious consequences for europe and its information society will be taken tomorrow .
i am counting on a ' yes ' to galileo and on the insight of the council of transport ministers .
we need a unanimous political vote and no more beating about the bush .
the critics still around should be told that the public-private partnership is feasible provided there is a clear political vote .
military use may be possible , but it is not a prerequisite .
the infrastructure created by galileo will have a much higher added value in the future than other previous infrastructure measures .
technologically-minded young people in europe will find attractive new jobs through galileo .
europe 's high tech industry will be at the top of the world league in this forward-looking sector .
the so-called market value of galileo increases in indirect proportion to the start-up capital needed .
we must be able to insist on the european negotiating principle of burden sharing in this sector too .
it should not be too painful for the member states to meet each other half way under these circumstances ; on the contrary it should be a piece of cake .
we must do the job properly now !
tomorrow will be too late !
our biggest competitor , the usa , is laughing all the way to the bank and is delighted at every setback in europe .
after all , we still need seven or eight years to roll out .
presidents persson and prodi rightly and emphatically drew our attention to this new technological opportunity for a modern europe at the start of this morning 's debate .
i repeat : galileo is a gateway to a european information society and i expect the council of transport ministers to perceive it as such tomorrow .
mr president , on the galileo project i would like to seek some clarification from the commission and the council on important issues which need to be addressed before the definitive phase of the project can be approved .
the memorandum of understanding signalling the provisional funding from private bodies of eur 200 million needs further explanation .
could the commission therefore give specific examples of some of the businesses which have agreed to the funding ?
could the commission also comment in this regard on the lack of a political commitment to come out of the stockholm summit ?
surely vague rhetoric will not suffice when billions of euro are at stake and the deadline , according to the commission 's timetable , is less than three months away ?
could the commission also provide an up-to-date breakdown of the contributions foreseen from individual member states ?
on development , is the commission aware that whilst the eu has been spending millions on galileo the us has been updating its existing technology ?
in conclusion , launching satellites is a very expensive business .
we need firm assurances that investments in the galileo project will produce an adequate return .
fundamental questions and less than three months to go .
unless the commission comes forward immediately with some answers on this project , we in the eu run the risk of appearing amateurish and irresponsible .
i therefore urge the commission and council to consider these points .
at a cost of billions to the taxpayer , to whom we are directly responsible , we are entitled to some answers .
i have received seventeen motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
area of freedom , security and justice
the next item is the joint debate on
and
council and commission statements on illegal immigration and the running aground of the " east sea " off the french coast with around 1 000 kurdish immigrants on board .
mr president , today we are debating the annual report on the area of freedom , security and justice created at the tampere summit in october 1999 .
the second issue is freedom .
freedom is a product of justice .
freedom is based on human dignity .
but , to prevent freedom from being abused , we need security , because without security and without justice , freedom is the law of the strongest .
we do not want a law of the strongest , we want a law of the weakest , which is why we need a security policy based on justice .
there are considerable deficits in the cross-border fight against crime , in collaboration in judicial matters and in the unification of law .
the european parliament suggested this on my initiative three years ago .
i am grateful that a few member states are now pressing in the council for uniform border controls on the external borders of the european union .
but we also want to ask the council in this extremely important debate exactly how it sees its responsibility vis-à-vis the european parliament .
we have begun excellent collaboration with the commission and with commissioner vitorino but we have identified a number of clear deficits as regards cooperation in the area of justice and internal affairs .
we are holding today 's debate without a written annual report or any documents on the part of the council on what has been done and still needs to be done in this crucial political area .
the commission scoreboard here is exemplary .
but there is no annual report from the council on what happened in the year 2000 in this crucial area .
i think that parliament should be properly informed and taken into account and that parliament needs to be more involved in the crucial area of justice and internal affairs .
we can see crucial deficits on the part of the council here .
you cannot build a citizens ' europe and yet bypass the elected representatives of the people , namely us parliamentarians .
finally , i should like to comment on the sensitive area of asylum law .
what we are lacking here - as in justice and internal affairs as a whole - is a strategic approach on the part of the council .
we have a plethora of often contradictory initiatives from the individual states .
we call on the council to make good these deficits .
mr president , honourable members of the european parliament , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank you for inviting myself and my colleague mrs klingvall .
it is a great honour to be able to talk to you today .
the european parliament is a very important player in european integration and the swedish presidency places great emphasis on having a good relationship with you .
we hope we have been able to demonstrate this ambition in part , particularly in meeting committees in stockholm .
this is a very relevant area which we are discussing today .
studies clearly show that judicial cooperation is close to the heart of european citizens .
today , organised crime largely transcends national borders , not least because of the development of new technology .
there are justified demands and higher expectations from the european citizens that we really will deliver results , in both the field of justice and home affairs .
as you possibly know , on justice issues we currently have the heaviest legislation programme within the whole union .
implementation is , as you know , now at a very intense stage .
although the treaty only refers to the third pillar , i and my colleagues do not wish to restrict the debate to questions concerning the third pillar .
often there is an intimate link between issues falling under the first and third pillars .
in general it can be said that the year 2000 , which is what we are reporting on today , is year one of the post-tampere period .
as i said , tampere meant a major step forward in justice and home affairs , and a very ambitious programme was adopted .
i would like to begin by briefly mentioning some of the progress made in the field of justice during 2000 .
in that year the justice and home affairs council passed around twenty legal instruments , eight of which were regulations and three conventions .
action plans have been adopted for almost all areas of activity on justice and home affairs .
over and above this the council adopted over thirty conclusions , resolutions , recommendations and reports .
progress was made on a number of issues by the very successful french and portuguese presidencies .
decisions were reached in several important areas in terms of combating economic crime .
we took the first step in the process towards setting up eurojust , which we consider an incredibly important aspect in the fight against organised crime .
we made major efforts in the fight against it crime , e.g. by adopting a decision on combating child pornography on the internet .
furthermore , we succeeded in developing the principle of mutual recognition by adopting a programme of measures regarding mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases .
several decisions were also passed to improve cooperation in the field of civil law , for example , on the service of documents , insolvency and on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters .
having said this i would like to focus on the question posed by mr posselt .
i will attempt to respond to the parts concerning justice and home affairs , while my colleague mrs klingvall will reply to the questions concerning asylum and immigration .
the treaty of amsterdam and the tampere conclusions have meant major changes in the field of justice and home affairs .
as i said earlier , ambitious plans have been laid down and the rate of work is increasing .
not only the scope but also the character of cooperation has changed .
the institutions have partly taken on new roles and the way they work is being redesigned .
we are in the middle of the implementation of tampere , and we can identify certain areas in which all the institutions are adapting to new conditions .
the treaty provides a clear framework for formal relations between the council and the european parliament when legal instruments and other instruments are being drawn up in the field of justice and home affairs .
the council is fully aware that the ambitious work in this area also means a considerable workload for you in parliament .
here we have to jointly take responsibility for the future of the eu .
it is important that we focus on what is important and really focus our time and energy on the central issues of eu development .
the swedish presidency has begun discussions on the way the council works .
one question which will be addressed in the overview which has begun is the constantly increasing multitude of initiatives in the area of justice and home affairs .
it is my conviction that we must achieve better predictability and coordination when it comes to new legislation initiatives .
such an improvement would make the joint work of the institutions much easier .
i would also like to say something about the relationship between the institutions and europol and eurojust respectively .
it is the conviction of the presidency that parliament 's access to and opportunities to monitor , for instance , the work of europol , can and should be improved .
the presidency considers that this ought to be able to be arranged in practice .
there may be measures which can be taken in the short term and which may not require any regulatory changes .
when it comes to eurojust , the council has not yet begun to discuss how parliament and commission are to be involved in the work and given the opportunity to monitor operations .
it is nonetheless clear that questions concerning relations between eurojust , the commission and parliament will be addressed in the negotiations .
where this issue , too , is concerned , i would like , however , to emphasise that we must consider the opportunity of further improving conditions for parliament to gain access .
before addressing the next question , i would like to emphasise our aim of maintaining good relations with you .
to emphasise this we submitted a written report to you yesterday that clearly lays out the work of the council in the field of justice and home affairs during the past year .
mr posselt also mentions the principle of mutual recognition and the measures which are planned to improve the mutual recognition of judgments in the field of criminal law .
in december last year , in the light of the conclusions from tampere , the council adopted a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition .
this programme of measures is ambitious and wide-ranging .
it contains a large number of measures which are to be implemented .
the principle of mutual recognition as expressed in the programme of measures covers decisions before the judgment , the judgment itself and decisions after the judgment .
in light of this , sweden , together with belgium and france , has taken the initiative for an instrument on decisions before judgments .
this concerns mutual recognition of decisions , and the freezing of assets and evidence .
the instrument aims to quickly prevent assets and evidence being hidden from the authorities investigating the crime .
when the instrument was presented , it was received positively , and negotiations will begin this spring during the swedish presidency .
during the spring it is likely that initiatives concerning mutual recognition and enforcement of fines will be submitted .
this will see the beginning of work in recognising and implementing the judgments themselves .
i would also like to mention cooperation in the field of civil law , particularly the work which has commenced to create a european enforcement order for uncontested debts .
a european enforcement order , unlike a national one , could be enforced in all member states without any inter-state control .
this is the first important step towards our goals , namely for judgments in one member state to be able to be recognised and enforced directly throughout the entire union .
in the work in creating an area of freedom , security and justice , we are largely dependent on legal instruments which must be implemented in the national law of member states .
a number of instruments which we agreed on at the end of the 1990s have already been able to enter into force .
furthermore , we currently have an opportunity to implement several instruments despite the fact that they have not entered into force in all member states .
after the entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam , several community legal instruments , such as regulations , have been adopted in the field of justice and home affairs .
several of these instruments have already entered into force or are on the way to doing so .
one concrete example is what is known as the brussels ii regulation on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters .
we initially also mentioned that we are in the process of producing an overview of our working methods at jha .
the question of the member states ' implementation of the measures taken in the field of jha is one of the questions addressed in this context .
i do not rule out further measures being needed if member states are better to live up to what they have undertaken in the council .
some form of control of implementation may be one way of putting pressure on all of us to really fulfil our undertakings .
the presidency today has no final solutions as to what such a mechanism would look like .
the proposal referred to in the question , an annual report , may be one way but the council will have to return to that question with more concrete information at a later date .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , members of the council , i wish to begin by thanking mr posselt for having tabled the oral question that has formed the basis for this debate .
1999 was a turning point in the field of justice and home affairs .
2000 marked the beginning of the implementation of the tampere mandate .
in the commission 's opinion , it is no exaggeration to say that we have made a good start .
we feel that we have made a proposal for a scoreboard with whose structure and content you are all familiar and i shall therefore not go into this in detail .
through this scoreboard , however , we will be able to identify , transparently , clearly and with a sense of responsibility , the progress as well as the delays in the way we are implementing the tampere mandate .
the commission takes the view that a dynamic scoreboard such as we would wish this to be responds to mr posselt 's concern .
i acknowledge that , although we have made a good start , we are entitled to have conflicting feelings about the union 's decision-making power in this field .
here we are faced with two problems that i see no reason to hide .
the first concerns the myriad initiatives of the member states , the reasoning behind which sometimes escapes us .
it is not my intention to question the member states ' right of initiative .
consolidating an area of freedom , security and justice can only be achieved through close cooperation between all the union 's institutions and also - and perhaps most importantly - between the member states .
hence the commission 's willingness to explore all avenues for improving cooperation with member states in exercising legislative initiative .
secondly , and it is worth saying this now , in advance of laeken , we risk facing delays in meeting the tampere timetable .
the commission is willing to play its part , under the leadership of the swedish presidency , in this task of discussing and streamlining the council 's methods for taking action .
with regard to the specific questions raised by mr posselt , i shall be very brief .
none of the other conventions has , to date , been signed and ratified by all 15 member states .
with regard to the framework decisions , it is too early to talk about their transposal because they are still very recent and there are not yet enough of them to be able to produce an assessment report .
we presented a proposal on family reunification , which i hope will be adopted during the swedish presidency .
we also presented a proposal on the rights and responsibilities of third-country nationals who are long-term residents .
in the field of immigration , i do not think that we should ignore the prospect of a proactive policy of integrating immigrant communities into the reception societies .
in this policy of integrating immigrants , we must be able to count on the commitment and support of the member states ' regions and local authorities .
i hope that , under the leadership of the swedish presidency , we will be able to conclude a political agreement on temporary protection .
the best solution to the problem of sharing responsibility is likely to be a common european asylum system based on the ideas outlined in the commission 's communication of last november .
with regard to the interinstitutional dialogue , mr president , the commission wishes to confirm here that the dialogue between the council , the commission and the european parliament is essential to a successful outcome .
in this field , the commission and parliament must be given a greater role to play in the democratic control of europol . this is another initiative that the commission will be adopting in the course of this year .
we have an ambitious programme and i am confident that the swedish and belgian presidencies will ensure that the right pace is set for us to achieve a favourable outcome at laeken .
if there have been delays , they are certainly not due to a lack of proposals or opinions issued by parliament .
i respect the diversity of parliament 's political and ideological opinions , but we do have a common objective , which is to convey to the people of europe a clear political message that meets their expectations .
let us take pride in our european identity .
i am delighted at the commitment of the swedish presidency , even if a great many problems still remain to be resolved .
i shall start with the last point . you have my support here , commissioner .
you feel that we need a new modus operandi here .
we spend a great deal of time on parallel initiatives which very often have no legal basis and which we often suspect are nationally motivated rather than concerned with finding european solutions .
we need an efficient mechanism for pushing ahead with the positive aspects here .
the second point is that there has been a dramatic increase in both drug abuse in the european union and in drug production , especially the production of synthetic drugs , in the european union .
in the meantime , there are now over 5 million young people taking synthetic drugs .
the european union has become the biggest producer and exporter of synthetic drugs in the world .
and if we look at the scoreboard , then we can see that very little action has been taken .
an initiative plan was submitted in 2000 , but no further action was taken .
i would ask for this to be made a new focal point .
finally , i should like to mention one more thing .
where there is no bearing on reality , as in the case of family reunion ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
a comparison between the initial forecasts and the latest revision of the scoreboard shows , for instance , how we have progressed - i would say remarkably - in matters of judicial cooperation .
my group also values the highly significant commission communication on the mutual recognition of sentences in criminal matters .
we hope it will be a solid base from which to combat crime , especially those more callous and intolerable versions such as terrorism .
ministers , we are well aware of what the european commission has presented this last year in connection with the tampere agenda : it is on the scoreboard .
what we do not know is what the council is thinking of doing with them in the immediate future .
today we have also talked about the shock caused by the arrival of the " east sea " in europe .
but the citizens do not know .
in fact , the impression given by the press is that not even our government knows .
laeken is going to be a new opportunity for the common immigration and asylum policy .
please do not just reaffirm the tampere decisions again .
tell us how you intend to move forward .
please do not repeat that things are on the right road .
really convince yourselves that your decisions are good ones , and uphold them clearly and with determination and courage .
parliament - and i am sure in this respect the citizens too - will follow .
mr president , our efforts to create an area of freedom , security and justice are dispersed and rather incoherent .
in this crucial area of creating a citizens ' europe , we start with a pretty incoherent framework .
on asylum policy , it is crucial that we absolutely respect humanitarian obligations and practise coherent thinking .
we really do not have much joined-up thinking on that subject .
mr president , during the night of 31 march , another ship carrying illegal immigrants ran aground to the north-east of athens , just like the kurdish refugees on 18 february off the coast of var , in france .
these are not national problems .
regularly , in gibraltar , at calais and elsewhere , refugees are coming ashore at european ports .
they risk their lives to flee from dictatorships , conflict and misery .
however , they are likely to end up as illegal immigrants , and they know it .
one only has to look at france , where 94 % of applications for asylum are rejected .
yet the right of asylum is a fundamental and inalienable right .
there is a european fund to provide support for the consequences of receiving these people here .
in order to improve efficiency , is the council thinking of assessing the use of resources from this fund ?
at the present time , two mechanisms are being studied ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
words should now be followed by actions .
yes , europe does have a duty to take initiatives , but not the sort of initiatives that would cause a breach of solidarity , or impose arbitrary sanctions on transport companies .
we also need to take restrictive and punitive measures , not against the victims , but against those who are behind this human traffic .
so when shall we see an end to the expulsions , when will the situation of illegal immigrants living on european soil be regularised , and when will non-community foreigners have the right to vote in local elections ?
it is impossible to avoid answering these questions if we want to move towards a policy that is more just , more humane and more effective .
i have three remarks in connection with this question .
first of all , a comment on the semantics .
both the treaty and the question talk about introducing an ' area of freedom , security and justice ' .
the impression might be created that freedom , security and justice did not exist in the member states , as if our countries were a legal vacuum .
however , that is not the case .
the situation , of course , is that we have a wide range of very traditional and deeply rooted legal systems which are distinguished primarily by their extraordinary difference from one another .
to introduce an area of freedom , security and justice is an absurdity from a semantic point of view .
however , there is also , of course , another objective , and that brings me on to my second remark , which is of a legal nature .
finally , i have a political remark to make .
this empire building through the establishment of a legal system represents one of the most repressive systems of oppression in world history .
a system is being developed which suspends the crucial aspects of legal security .
objection can also be made to this perversion of the language which should ideally , of course , reflect reality as carefully as possible . that is something it is nowhere near doing .
mr president , how many minutes 'silence have we held so far in this parliament for the victims of eta and in condemning terrorism ?
how many people have lost their lives in attempting to tread on european soil along the andalusian coastline , in dover , or on the coasts of southern france or italy ?
how many women and children have been and still are exploited by organised criminal networks that - and this is the worst part - act with impunity in european territory ?
we must begin to find answers to these questions now , and fast !
no terrorist , drug trafficker or trafficker in human beings must find shelter in a member state .
and it is urgent , as the commissioner has said , to set the european search and capture order in motion against these enemies of freedom and security .
i particularly wish to thank you , commissioner , for the interest you have shown in setting this european search and capture order in motion .
in spain a recent survey has shown that terrorism and immigration have become two of the main concerns of spanish citizens .
these concerns also require european responses .
we are going to have two great debates in the coming months : a report on terrorism and another on immigration and asylum .
instead , we are faced with fragmentary and uncoordinated initiatives on individual issues on the part of the member states , initiatives which often fall outside the framework agreed at tampere .
( the president cut the speaker off )
progress has been made in finding ways to work together in a policy field in which the treaties are anything but satisfactory .
the house that we are building for our citizens should be able to withstand an earthquake .
let us lay the most solid foundations - those of the community framework in which architects , builders and surveyors work together in concert .
parliament has called for an annual report on the implementation of the area of freedom , security and justice .
in welcoming the report that i have just received from the presidency , i note that it is essentially a list of actions .
what we will need is an assessment of the impact of measures taken .
minister klingvall said it is hard to comment on the case of the " east sea " because it is a matter for individual member states .
arguably that may be true for 24 hours ; thereafter it is a matter for all of us .
surely , minister , that is the whole point of the area of freedom , security and justice .
member states must understand that this is an area in which citizens want more europe .
we must rise to that challenge , not become bidders in a depressing downward auction of rights for our citizens or those arriving from elsewhere .
the charter of fundamental rights is arguably the most important development that we have seen .
the question is : if we really want more freedom , security and justice , what must we do in order to prevent this policy from claiming even more lives ?
first , freedom is achieved by giving people a free choice of where they wish to live .
secondly , security is given to people by pressing a passport into their hand and giving them the legal wherewithal to set up home wherever they want .
this results in more justice and greater fairness because it is the global economic conditions which the industrialised countries have forced on the world which turn many people into refugees in the first place .
which is why i call on the council to take prevention seriously .
a uniform modus operandi - yes , start a legalisation initiative now , because that is the only consistent policy against racism .
mr president , the running aground of the " east sea " on the french coast is a tragic illustration of a twofold problem : the problem of oppressed nations and the problem of the oppression of immigrants .
at the present time , the kurdish people , scattered over several countries , are experiencing pitiless oppression which highlights the on-going struggle to force the government to respect the right to self-determination and to respect national minorities .
moreover , these tragedies that we have seen occurring on spanish beaches or at dover cannot result merely in our condemning the people who ship in the illegal immigrants .
the schengen area is a fortress which forces the victims of hunger or of political dictatorships to take illegal action .
yet everyone knows that no amount of policing can halt the flow of people who are in fear of their lives .
those who organise these shipments of illegal immigrants are now growing fat on these repressive laws , which in any case are a violation of the geneva convention .
it is time to open up the borders to the free circulation of people , just as you have done for capital .
we no longer want to see the spectacle of entire families entering europe by paying large sums of money to risk their lives in decrepit old tubs .
mr president , in view of the short time available , i will address the most important point first .
it is quite worrying that the presidency does not respect the opinion of parliament .
i myself think that it is fairly clear after the debate today that responsibility for overall policy in this field should rest with the commission .
alarming figures are presented regarding population trends - europe is shrinking .
member states are estimated to lose 10 percent and candidate countries 20 percent .
we will see a shortage of both highly qualified and less qualified labour , and both in the short and the long term .
our external borders are under great pressure .
the fact that europe must be opened up to immigration of labour is a conclusion which even the toughest opposition have adopted .
has the council no practical solutions in this area ?
will crime and harsh reality decide ?
we look forward to the proposals which the commission will present in this field .
the commission appears to be the most suitable body to do this .
mr president , i would like to thank both the ministers from sweden , as well as the commission , for their comments .
some people describe europe as a europe which locks people out .
they term it ' fortress europe ' .
i share the view of the commission and the presidency that the current deficiencies in the field of asylum and refugees are linked to the problem that we have no common policy .
at the moment , there are different policies in different countries .
the policy we have to develop must be based on international conventions , needs for protection and family reunification .
at least that is the way i clearly understood it .
i also think that we should distinguish between immigration of labour , and asylum and refugee policy .
the latter is based on people 's need for protection .
the former is based on the fact that we are suddenly realising that we will have a shortage of labour in the years to come , and here we are considering our need for labour .
today , however , we are seeing these people remain largely outside society , that they do not have the same rights and that they are not utilised on the labour market .
they tend to be found among the 14 million unemployed .
mr president , it is touching to hear how loyally the swedish minister has adopted the propaganda language of the eu liturgy .
freedom , security , justice - but there is no such thing !
freedom in gibraltar , for those who drown in attempting to enter the eu ?
freedom at the polish eastern border where the soviet border is now physically being used as the eu 's external border in the opposite direction ?
is this freedom ?
security - when we are all being monitored by the sis register , which knows everything , even down to whether we have any sexual peculiarities ?
justice - when all the police officers working on this say that the identity checks which will become compulsory under the schengen agreement will affect those who look non-european ?
mrs klingvall , mr bodström !
there is a word for this , a rude word : - ' fortress europe ! '
that is what you are building , precisely what you promised you would not build !
how would it be if you built in the opposite direction instead of solely going along with the federalists and power builders in this institution ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , almost every day we read articles in the papers about refugees stranded on the coasts of europe .
just last sunday , 447 kurdish refugees landed in greece .
in february the " east sea " freighter ran aground in st. rafael in france with almost 1 000 kurdish refugees , including over 300 children , on board .
their odyssey to europe had lasted ten days under inhumane conditions .
three women gave birth to children in these conditions .
the refugees sell all their worldly possessions in order to buy a passage to europe .
that refugees are putting their lives at even greater risk is the consequence of the eu 's segregation policy .
it is intolerable .
europe 's borders must be open to people in need , fleeing their homeland .
why does anyone leave their homeland ?
where are the refugees who willingly leave their homeland ?
no one leaves their homeland willingly unless they are being persecuted and fear torture and maltreatment .
i think we should fight the reasons why they flee .
i call on the commission , the council and the governments of the european union to apply this policy and put it into practice .
europe does not just need an economic face , it also needs a human face .
our action arrives late and is ineffective because community initiatives come to a halt on the threshold of cooperation in matters of criminal justice , which are still dealt with on an intergovernmental basis .
we need to be more courageous in protecting the rights of the citizens .
mr president , i should like to emphasise certain issues which are no less important for being evident and having been reiterated in this debate .
what is needed is a new boost and greater political will to be able to fulfil the agenda and the objectives that are set out for us .
therefore , let me remind you that we already have a programme of initiatives presented by the commission which , in my view , meets these requirements .
why do we not all focus on this programme ?
we shall avoid the tragedies that occur on the coasts of southern spain every day , with boats laden with human beings reaching our shores and with people dying in their holds .
for this we need a clear political will and sufficient budgetary funding .
mr president , jag vill prata franska &#91; i should now like to speak in french &#93; .
everything was for the best in the best of all worlds .
everyone finds their own particular satisfaction in this : this is how the pro-immigrant associations justify their existence , and the public subsidies that they enjoy .
governments end up regularising everybody , or almost everybody , thereby demonstrating their attachment to the essential values of tolerance , human rights and openness towards others .
the bishops fill the desperately empty churches with illegal immigrants .
and there you are , they landed , they are there , or rather - it has to be said - they were there .
for the question we are asking now , regardless of the reasons why they were beached and the conditions in which it happened , is this : what has become of them ?
they have disappeared , melted into the background , over 600 of these illegal immigrants have miraculously vanished , they have done a disappearing act .
for example , when the camp was closed by the prefect of var , on 1 march , 449 people were supposed to have been taken into custody .
since then , more than 200 of them have disappeared .
at modane , the destination of the first people leaving via the fréjus pass , of the 82 kurds welcomed with such ceremony , 40 have vanished into thin air .
but why has this happened ?
why , when all the politicians , the various interest groups and others have all called unanimously for these immigrants to be permanently received here ?
simply because these illegal immigrants preferred to use parallel secret networks for slipping into france and slipping out again .
what a psychological shock , what a cause for concern to the self-righteous .
unfortunately , this business is purely symbolic , it is a drop in the ocean , because every month there are thousands of illegal immigrants who succeed in getting into france .
but others will follow , millions of others , who will arrive on foot and by train .
our problem is to organise their return to their own countries so that they can live and work in those countries with dignity .
i will attempt to summarise and comment on your viewpoints and questions .
let me start by making it clear that we are working for a union characterised by freedom , security and justice .
none of us is interested in building a " fortress europe " .
rather our work is characterised by very great dynamism , a deeper cooperation in a europe which we also wish to see enlarged .
one of the foremost aims of the swedish presidency is enlargement .
it is to make this region larger , to integrate further countries into a deeper cooperation , not just for freedom , security and justice , but also for peace .
this work obviously has considerable dynamism .
this naturally also characterises our work on a harmonised asylum and immigration policy .
in addition , it characterises the holistic perspective that we are imposing on the harmonisation work emanating from the treaty of amsterdam and the conclusions reached in tampere .
we have all been incredibly moved and affected by the tragedies and catastrophes that we have seen come to us on our television screens .
this is a continuing and despicable trade .
it exploits people in vulnerable situations .
it is something that we must work against with considerable strength .
however , we must do so in a number of different ways - one way is not sufficient .
we must deal with the underlying causes of involuntary migration .
last week i was in the balkans together with commissioner vitorino and the belgian internal affairs minister , mr duquesne .
we met representatives of five of the baltic states in order to discuss precisely these matters .
the first of these is the issue of human trafficking .
where this is concerned i want to make a clear distinction between human trafficking which exploits vulnerable people and what we call humanitarian acts .
humanitarian acts must not be punishable .
we are working on a humanitarian clause concerning illegal entry .
we have decided that , where illegal residence is concerned , the existence or otherwise of the profit motive will be the key factor in determining which acts are of a specifically humanitarian character and cannot therefore be punished .
as far as the penalties are concerned : these must be severe .
we have not yet reached agreement on this , but we are currently discussing a primary proposal for a minimum penalty of six years .
where the question of transporters ' liability is concerned i wish to strongly reject what was said by mrs cederschiöld .
our exploratory work that is currently in progress provides a basis for reaching agreement on this in accordance with guidelines from the french presidency .
there are two viewpoints from the european parliament which i , as president , have also brought into the discussions .
this should mean that we defer the enforcement of fines on those who come to the eu and seek asylum despite the fact that they do not have adequate documents .
only when the asylum process is complete must those persons who are not allowed to stay be liable to pay these fines .
at the same time , it is , of course , reasonable for us to demand that transporters check passports and any visas .
however , the sanctions must not be disproportionately severe .
we do not yet know whether we will arrive at a solution that is acceptable to everyone , but we are sounding out the basis for this .
some of the contributions during the debate , such as the contributions from mrs terrón i cusí and baroness ludford , dealt with the continued work .
they wondered : " what is actually happening ?
you have this vision and the aim from tampere , but what are you actually doing ? "
i reported on some of the decisions taken .
i also reported on the status of the work in respect of some of the directives that are relevant .
allow me simply to emphasise that we hope that at our meeting in may we will be able to make decisions concerning the directive on temporary protection and the directive on the reunification of families .
the negotiating work on these directives is currently progressing well .
it is thus our hope that we will be able to make decisions in may .
we have also come a long way in respect of launching the eurodac system .
the test runs will be started in late summer 2001 .
we believe that this is a system which will be able to give us a more effective application of the dublin convention .
as regards the proposal for third country nationals ' rights , this has just been submitted .
however , we look forward to being able to commence work on this directive as well .
i also mentioned earlier in the debate that the belgian presidency will focus on immigration policy and arrange a seminar on migration in october 2001 .
spain , too , has announced a ministerial conference in respect of flows of migration from asia in advance of its presidency .
we are working patiently , step-by-step , so as to be able to realise the scoreboard that has been proposed with a view to implementing the conclusions of the council 's summit in tampere .
the implementation work is still in its initial stages , but we are moving forward and naturally we want to make decisions as quickly as possible .
mr president , criminality is becoming increasingly international .
the only way in which we can fight this tendency is for the police and the prosecuting authorities to also work more at an international level and to cooperate .
all police work involves violating the integrity of those who are suspected of a crime .
this is true both at national and at international level .
it applies to people who are sought by the authorities .
in order to be able to conduct a debate on the matter , it is important that we have the right basis .
this applies , for example , to that which mr gahrton mentioned - namely the sis system , which is there for wanted persons .
mr gahrton said that the international sis system charts people 's sexual orientation .
this is incorrect !
there is no such or similar sensitive information in the system .
it contains information on persons who are wanted , whether they are armed , their descriptions and other things such as information on stolen vehicles .
there is thus no such sensitive information and it is an incredibly important instrument if we are to be able to combat international criminality .
the only people who are served by having no international cooperation are the criminals .
i would also like to point to the work that is in progress for arriving at a solution in respect of synthetic drugs .
i know that mrs cederschiöld has fought very hard on this matter , and hopefully we can reach some kind of political agreement in may .
mr watson and mrs terón i cusí , amongst others , have taken up the issue of how we can become more effective , which is , of course , important .
it is important for instance when the proposals are put forward by the member states and initiatives are taken on various matters .
it is important that this is done in the right way and that we do not concentrate on short-term successes , for example at domestic level .
it is in everyone 's interest for the cooperation to work and be effective .
everyone stands to gain , including from the domestic point of view , if it works as it should .
the same applies to the cooperation between the member states , the council , the european parliament and the commission .
if this does not work it will create a negative impression .
our citizens will lose confidence in us and without the confidence of our citizens the eu will have no foundation , as a result of which the eu would not work either .
consequently it is important that this very constructive and important debate continues in the same way as it has done today .
finally , i would like to thank you all once again for this and for allowing me to come here .
therefore , i hope that at the end of the swedish presidency we will have concrete and good results on the basis of which to proceed .
the sooner we get a more detailed assessment of the concrete results of such an action plan , the better .
we also have to bear in mind that one candidate country , turkey , is a neighbouring country of iraq .
so we should engage turkey more seriously in the debate on the kurdish situation and on the effect of illegal immigration in the area .
my second point is to say to mr pirker that i did not touch upon the issue of drugs in my presentation , because there was no question tabled about it .
however , i would draw the attention of parliament to the fact that we are implementing the 2000-2004 action plan .
there has been a very important swedish initiative on synthetic drugs .
the second one is to put before the council and parliament what we call a follow-up table for the action plan on drugs .
in that follow-up table we will include all the actions that need to be taken by the union , and also identify all concrete actions that should be taken by individual member states .
so we are not neglecting the drugs issue .
we did not touch upon that point , because you did not refer to it in the formal questions , but i am glad to announce to you our programme as far as combating drugs is concerned .
my final wish and hope is that maybe next year we will have a more cheerful debate on the state of play in the area of freedom , security and justice .
let us all work together to that end .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on wednesday 16 may .
un conference on least-developed countries
the next item is the following two oral questions :
b5-0155 / 2001 , by mr miranda , on behalf of the committee on development and cooperation , to the council , on the third un conference on least-developed countries ,
b5-0156 / 2001 , by mr miranda , on behalf of the committee on development and cooperation , to the commission , on the third un conference on least-developed countries .
that is the precise purpose of the oral questions to the council and the commission that i am presenting today .
i also hope to make a contribution to this with the proposal for a resolution that i am tabling .
we are all - i hope - aware of the tragic situation these countries are experiencing .
i therefore feel that this conference must do more than simply repeat the diagnosis that is made so often and neither should it be a mere list , exhaustive or not , of intentions that systematically go unfulfilled .
on this subject , we must remember that only 12 developing countries are represented in geneva .
i would simply like to emphasise that this is an initiative to be welcomed , although it is of limited scope and although it contains some aspects that need to be fine-tuned .
since it is merely the first step , as has been said , it must be supplemented with various other types of measure such as those that i have just outlined .
lastly , at a time when the need to fight poverty is being so greatly emphasised , i think i should emphasise two more specific objectives that are worth repeating : health and education .
as i stated in my proposal for a resolution , the industrialised countries must make a decisive contribution to the development of programmes in these fields .
on these and other aspects , many of which are developed further in the resolution that i have tabled , we now await the words of the council and the commission .
firstly , active and responsible participation by national authorities , civil society , the private sector and local players in the least developed countries .
within the framework of the union 's development assistance policy a very great part of the assistance is devoted to precisely these least developed countries , particularly through the acp / eu conventions .
i would remind you that 40 of the 49 least developed countries are also included in the group of acp countries .
the union feels that the elimination of poverty in these countries should be the central aim of the conference .
the union cannot accept the commitments and / or obligations in respect of debt write-offs that go beyond the terms that apply under the hipc initiative .
the resources that are released under the hipc initiative are to be used to fight poverty in accordance with the countries ' own poverty strategies .
the regulation became applicable on 5 march this year .
discussion of this matter began with the commission putting forward a proposal in october last year .
in nearly all cases this access was established from 5 march this year .
only in the matter of bananas , sugar and rice was it established that this should enter into force at a later date .
however , the crucial factor was that a particular period and timetable for full access to the market was agreed for these products .
the market for bananas will be fully liberalised from 2006 and that for sugar and rice from july 2009 and september 2009 respectively .
during this period duty on these three products will be reduced and duty-free quotas will be established for sugar and rice .
the regulation is therefore of crucial economic significance for the least developed countries .
however , it also has an even greater political and economic significance in respect of the preparations for the next round of negotiations in the wto .
the fact that in this regard it is , in the first instance , development priorities that have formed the basis for a decision on a trade matter has incredibly great symbolic value .
it shows that the union fully accepts a moral and economic responsibility in accordance with the union 's position as the world 's biggest trading bloc .
mr president , as the president of the council has just pointed out , this third un conference on ldcs will take place in brussels in may .
preparations for this conference are underway .
obviously , as joint host , the european union has a special interest in making this conference a success : teams from the commission and a certain number of commissioners are working on it together .
although we are so keen on this initiative , that is not because we think it is sufficient in itself .
it is clear that , without an appropriate environment and other aid efforts , the vast majority of the ldcs are incapable , on their own , of taking advantage of commercial openings .
i am thinking , in particular , of all aspects of health and plant health .
this being the case , let us not hide behind speeches that are too politically correct .
we must also be clear .
from this point of view it is important that the role of each party should be clear .
we must remember that these measures that i have just spoken about , which come into effect immediately , are only part of the result .
they have to be there in order to lend a certain amount of credibility to the action programme for the next ten years .
this action programme will serve as an itinerary .
i believe that it is very important to have an itinerary in this area , and it must be one that we can control together .
it must be pointed out that the poorest and the least developed countries must be given special attention and , in the process , elimination of extreme poverty should be the primary goal .
good governance is a key issue in the ldcs .
we in this parliament should promote the rule of law as an essential criterion when we look at good governance criteria .
it is a matter of record also that the proportion of our aid budgets that goes to the ldcs has fallen while the proportion that goes to middle-ranking countries , such as morocco and algeria , has risen .
this is absolutely wrong .
the aid budget must concentrate on the poorest .
that is what our citizens expect and require .
using the aid budget as some sort of underhand immigration policy is wrong .
have an anti-immigration policy , by all means , but be honest about it .
we must not rob the poorest countries to achieve our own political ends .
finally , we must do everything we can to prevent conflict .
conflict prevention is a key to helping the ldcs grow .
mr president , as others have already suggested , the facts speak for themselves .
most of the 640 million people who live in the least developed countries , just over one-tenth of the world 's entire population , are struggling to survive on less than two dollars a day .
their average life expectancy is 50 years .
half of them are illiterate and two-thirds of the world 's children , most of them little girls , are not in any kind of primary education .
ldcs have seen a severe drop in capital flows , down 45 % since 1990 ; and official development assistance continues to go down , having fallen by 30 % since 1990 .
as the president-in-office has said , the hipc initiative is yielding very slow results and coming in too late .
too many ldcs have totally unsustainable debt burdens .
many ldcs , such as zambia for example , where i was recently , are still spending twice as much on debt servicing as they are on health and education .
this un conference therefore has to be about a new deal for ldcs ; one that promotes pro-poor economic growth , poverty reduction and sustainable development .
everything but arms represents significant progress .
i wonder whether commissioner lamy would be able to predict that other countries such as the us or japan might be prepared to follow his excellent lead .
i think i see him smile , and this might present us with some difficulties .
mr president , the gap with the poorest countries is widening instead of narrowing .
over the past decade , aid to developing countries has fallen by 24 % and that to the poorest by as much as 45 % .
this is absolutely unacceptable .
the un conference is pointless if it remains bogged down in fine promises and vague declarations .
the poorest countries only benefit from concrete and binding agreements .
trade concessions on their own are not sufficient .
the rich countries must ease their burden of debt by a substantial amount .
repayment means that in many countries , any form of development is frustrated even before it gets off the ground .
it is of the utmost importance that we should pursue a separate discharge policy for each developing country individually .
debt relief has no meaning if debts keep mounting up .
the european commission 's policy should therefore be aimed at developing capacity and sensible financial management .
only then can countries develop education and health care ; only then can investments be stimulated .
in many of the poorest developing countries , power , as well as available resources , are very badly distributed .
if political and economic power are not distinctly separated , only corruption can reign supreme .
it is hopeless to fight poverty if countries remain trapped in violent conflict .
let us call a spade a spade : tyranny and unbounded greed on the part of irresponsible leaders are just as important in terms of causing inadequate development as is a drop in aid .
the chasm between rich and poor can only be bridged if our aid effort is stepped up considerably and if the countries are better governed .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , i would like to confine myself to a small number of questions .
how honest are we , in fact , when we claim that we mainly fight poverty in the least developed countries ?
our fellow meps have illustrated this amply .
furthermore , we find that our aid does not even reach the poorest in the poor countries - and surely that is what all this is about - for they remain in poverty .
how coherent is our own policy ?
how honest are we when we claim that we are quite willing to import everything , except weapons , from the poor countries ?
is this not , in the first instance , an act of goodwill to include the southern countries in a new wto round ?
i wonder about that , for i note that we remain caught up in our own incoherence .
i would like to quote the delay of imports of sugar as a case in point : that is nothing but a disgrace !
must we really continue to support our own sugar production ?
surely there is no reason for doing that !
mr president , on the subject of aid to developing countries , and in particular to those known as the least-developed countries , what are the facts ?
we discovered these facts just now .
the mandate for the third un conference covers , in particular , public development aid , debt and trade .
in that case , we must not try to evade the following conclusion , namely that the commitments made for the preceding decade have not been fulfilled .
it has often been said , but it is necessary to repeat it , that the decrease in the flow of public development aid is unacceptable .
it has dwindled by almost half during the last decade , falling to only 0.05 % of the gdp of the donor countries , far below the 0.7 % objective set by the un .
in europe , only the northern countries are meeting this commitment .
moreover , the proportion of this public development aid that is spent on economic infrastructure and the production sector has also been reduced .
what does the future hold for these countries , if they cannot achieve a level of development which will enable them to make choices that are truly independent ?
there is no need to seek further afield for the reasons for the results that have been obtained .
the mere mention of the fall in life expectancy to 51 years gives an indication of the size of the disaster .
worse that this , as unctad reports , the least-developed countries are caught in a downward spiral and a vicious circle of economic regression , social tensions and violence , which all reinforce one another .
thus the proportion of their gdp accounted for by the manufacturing sector has not increased , and in some cases it has even decreased .
the ldcs are still , in many cases , exporters of only one or two basic products .
production capacity has been reduced in some countries .
europe 's political authority is achieved from its capacity to stand up to an all-consuming globalisation governed only by the laws of commerce and of money .
i believe that development cannot be summed up simply as the organisation of trading relations ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , the question which arises is : what is preventing the developed countries from helping the poor countries more effectively ?
the percentage of the gdp dedicated by the wealthy states to the development of poor countries is increasingly small .
we know that , in many cases , these same wealthy countries flood the poor countries with toxic waste or allow shady businesses to operate in tourism as well .
it might cost little to treat a sick person and even less to prevent the illness , but aids is continuing to spread because of a lack of political will and economic commitment .
globalisation is proving to be a tragedy for all those who are poor and is certainly not increasing the prosperity of the wealthy .
if arrangements are to be of immediate effect , as the commission wishes , the eu must appreciate that the hipc agreement is quite inadequate .
there are enough tasks to get to grips with .
it is simply scandalous and something we cannot live with here in the european union .
providing ostensibly social aid and even slashing these countries ' debts are only cosmetic measures with no long-term effects .
it is amazing that often the countries richest in raw materials have the poorest population .
take the example of angola .
it is obvious that this system has been implemented on purpose .
the african country richest in raw materials was once the biggest coffee exporter in the world with enough money to feed its 12 million people easily .
mr president , the decision to grant the poorest countries access to the european market is a good start .
let us hope that the rest of the industrialised world will follow our lead .
but we need much more than that , and the health initiative for the least developed countries - " all but aids " - is a case in point .
95 % of people suffering from aids live in developing countries .
also , diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis claim too many victims annually .
healthcare in the poorest countries is seriously underfunded .
it appears that the least developed countries are spending as little as usd 8 per person on healthcare .
according to the who , this figure should be 8 or 9 times higher .
that is why the european union should have the courage to take unilateral initiatives at the third un conference in may .
i would like to list a few of these initiatives .
secondly , the eu should ask the member states to abolish the export tax on medicines for poverty-associated illnesses .
thirdly , aid for basic healthcare should be doubled in the 2001 community budget .
half of that amount should be earmarked for the least developed countries .
fifthly , we should openly declare our support for brazil and south africa as soon as charges are brought against them .
sixthly , we should defend the position on cheap medicines and the right to parallel imports , even in international forums , and should ask the trips agreement to be adapted accordingly .
europe should also free up extra monies for this fund .
such a unilateral step coming from europe would have far greater impact , precisely in the new bush era , than all kinds of general declarations .
we need tangible results .
i am convinced that the eu and mr lamy are extremely well placed to achieve these .
mr president , i would like to thank the members for the important contributions that have been made to this debate .
it is precisely this to which we hope the conference in brussels will provide very definite answers , not just fine words .
i have great respect for mrs sandbæk 's description of the ' everything but arms ' decision , but i still see this decision as an important step along the way .
this is an opportunity to show that the union is honest in its efforts to genuinely assist the least developed countries .
i agree that it would be desirable to go even further , but do not let us diminish this first step .
the swedish presidency has made conflict prevention one of its core issues .
we at the council have also asked if we may come back to this chamber later this spring to discuss conflict prevention .
moreover , conflict prevention will be an important issue at the european council 's conference in gothenburg in june .
i hope that this will provide an important reminder that the prevention of conflicts and efforts to help the least developed countries are very closely related .
mr president , i would like to make three comments in response to the debate .
the first has to do with the issue the president-in-office of the council has just addressed .
like most of you , i think that development results from an , at times very mysterious , alchemy , the ingredients of which are easy to name but whose mixture is difficult to achieve .
like mr deva and the president-in-office , i think that peace is probably the decisive ingredient ahead of such elements as the fight against corruption .
there are many others but i hope we can avoid giving the impression that the least-developed countries have a monopoly over such difficulties and troubles .
i think we ourselves do not always come out unscathed .
what would you have said had we failed in our attempt ?
these concrete decisions have been taken and are now going to be implemented .
mrs kinnock wanted to know which ldc countries in particular are likely to export arms .
the list has not been finalised .
i think that the conference on the ldcs will enable us to exert a bit of pressure .
chile and new zealand have displayed positive tendencies .
we are well aware that , at least at this stage , japan will not fall into line as regards the totality of its imports , especially because of its rice problems .
nonetheless , as regards industrial rates , it has already taken measures which are in the right direction .
i would like to dispel any impression that we have in some way bought the agreement of least-developed countries so as to organise a round of commercial negotiations which is in our interest but not theirs .
such an impression is totally without foundation .
my third and final comment has to do with access to medicines .
this point was brought up by mr miranda , mrs boudjenah and mr van den berg .
this general plan is now on the table .
you are aware of it . it is available for you to read .
i have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 42 ( 5 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be taken tomorrow .
question time ( council )
the next item is question time to the council ( b5-0163 / 2001 ) .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
question no 1 by ( h-0248 / 01 )
subject : crisis in the balkans as developments in the balkans crisis have revealed , recognition of the borders of many countries in the region is a matter of direct or indirect contention .
what is the council 's view of these current developments and , in particular , what is its position on the acceptance of borders as a stabilising force in the balkans crisis ?
question no 2 by ( h-0259 / 01 )
terrorist operations and fighting , even involving the use of heavy weaponry , are reported on an almost daily basis .
the yugoslav peace plan for the presevo valley has , in principle , received a favourable response .
does the council agree that the above peace plan constitutes a sufficient basis for talks ?
what measures will it take to facilitate the opening of talks between the political leaders of the albanian-speaking population of southern serbia and the yugoslav leadership ?
question no 3 by ( h-0306 / 01 )
on the same occasion the council repeated that it stands firmly by the principle that all the borders in the area are inviolable .
at this time the commission announced that it would double its financial support in the presevo valley .
this support now amounts to nearly eur 2 million .
the commission is also considering what contributions can be made to serbia in the long term in accordance with the eur 240 million programme in 2001 .
the council reacted quickly and clearly to the serious incidents in fyrom that took place recently .
the ministerial troika visited skopje on 22 march and mr solana visited fyrom on a further two occasions , on 20 and 26-27 march .
the council entirely rejects the tendentious and unfounded allegations in the honourable member of parliament 's question no 306 concerning the role of nato and kfor in the crisis in fyrom .
the eu position is clearly stated in the declaration by the european council issued in stockholm on 23 march .
i am here on behalf of mr papayannakis .
i would like to thank the council of ministers for its answer , which i think was good in many ways .
does the council of ministers have any viewpoint on the demands being put forward by the albanian minority in macedonia ?
as i said in my introduction , the basis for any solution of the conflicts that we are now seeing must be a respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty .
this was also concluded by both the council and the european council on several occasions .
however , it is , of course , very important to bring about an intensification of the interethnic dialogue in various ways .
in general terms , the union - in the council 's opinion - should continue to do everything to promote this dialogue , whilst always having these fundamental principles in mind .
mr president , i shall overlook the fact that your reply was something of a " lord have mercy " to javier solana .
you mentioned his name five times and maybe it is better to leave him out of it when we are discussing the balkans .
but to get back to the point of my question .
your standpoint has one positive aspect - the council 's determination not to violate all the borders in the area .
i do not know whether this was a hymn of praise to mr solana .
mr president , may i say that i am totally dissatisfied with the council representative 's reply . first of all , i asked a straightforward question .
what is being done about applying security council resolution 1244 ?
and mr solana did the same .
is this what they mean by their determination to guard the borders ?
tell us once and for all , is kosovo a serbian province or an independent state ?
and then , mr president , i was struck by the presidency 's statement that presevo ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
i realise that mr korakas is not satisfied with my answer .
on behalf of the council i must once again reject some of the allegations in mr korakas ' question as tendentious .
who is it that must ensure that the un security council 's resolutions are observed ?
the union is one of the most important players in this respect and i hope and believe that the union will continue to be active .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , i am worried about events spiralling out of control in the balkans .
there is also talk of leaving unmanned american aeroplanes on bulgarian territory .
what i am wondering is , does íáôï intend to use bulgaria against fyrom in the same way as it used fyrom against yugoslavia ?
all this indicates the risk of a crisis spreading in bulgaria .
i should like to ask if the council has faced up to such a possibility and thought out any action .
the honourable member is clinging onto speculation regarding which the council cannot comment further .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
question no 4 by ( h-0290 / 01 ) :
question no 5 by ( h-0299 / 01 ) :
however , the first three months of 2001 have now elapsed , but only four more member states have ratified the statute .
where the national courts cannot or will not act , the international community has the ultimate responsibility for guaranteeing that justice is done .
the union therefore considers it necessary for the international criminal court to be set up within the near future in order to increase respect for international humanitarian rights and human rights .
by abolishing immunity from prosecution , the court will reinforce the rule of law and justice and contribute to consolidating world peace .
the union strongly recommends that the international criminal court be set up in the near future .
with this aim in mind the union started international efforts to encourage as many states as possible to sign up to the rome statute before the deadline expired on 31 december 2000 .
the union has also undertaken to encourage the countries with associate membership of the union to sign or ratify the statute and the union is offering its expertise in this area to all interested countries .
moreover , the union is firmly resolved to give its support to the actual setting up of the court .
the union expects the rome statute to enter into force in the near future , when the 60 ratifications required have been achieved , including ratification by all the union 's member states .
italy , france , belgium , spain , germany , austria , luxembourg and finland have already ratified the rome statute .
the other member states have all started the ratification process and in the majority of cases it should soon be completed , depending on the national procedure .
in this context it should be noted that the implementation of the rome statute in national legislation is a demanding task which , in a number of cases , even requires constitutional amendments .
the situation concerning the ratification of the rome statute in the union is regularly taken up by the presidency at meetings of the council 's working group on international law .
i should like to thank the president-in-office for his response and would like to give him some information of which he may not be aware .
the irish government has stated its intention to hold a referendum on 31 may 2001 to ratify the international criminal court and to alter our constitution for that .
as i mentioned in my answer the union has undertaken to help all the countries that are associated with the union to ensure that they can sign or ratify the statute .
in addition , we are offering technical expertise .
i am therefore convinced that with this commitment the union will contribute not just to the fifteen member states being able to participate fully in this important instrument as soon as possible , but also the associate countries .
the member asked about any national difficulties in the case of my own country , sweden .
as i said in my introduction , it is a fairly extensive process in many countries - including my own .
mr president-in-office of the council , i somehow get the impression that we are going to have to worm information out of you .
mr crowley has given us the good news that the irish government has stated its intention to ratify the international criminal court .
you have also just given us the good news that sweden will do likewise by the end of the next six-month period .
could you give us some good news about the five remaining countries , which are portugal , greece , great britain , the netherlands and denmark ?
you spoke of a long process , but three years is an awfully long time !
i thought the purpose of this question time was precisely to demand answers from the council , which is why i am very pleased to be able to answer mr dupuis 's question further .
where portugal is concerned , i know that the portuguese are hoping to be able to complete the process when some essential supplements have been made to the portuguese constitution before the summer recess .
as far as denmark is concerned , the matter was taken up for first reading in the danish parliament as long ago as last autumn .
it is expected that the second and third readings will be able to take place before the summer recess .
greece reports that it needs to amend its penal law .
it is expected that these changes will take a few months more .
they have not yet ventured to give an exact date for ratification .
finally , in the netherlands , a two-thirds majority is needed in parliament . however , it is hoped that the necessary legislation will be able to be adopted within a short time .
i wanted to ask the president-in-office about greece .
however , he has replied , so perhaps there is no point .
so i shall simply take this opportunity to say to mr dupuis , in connection with the previous question , you should show some respect , you really should .
one might accuse him of wanting to join mr le pen 's party - after all , they are already in the same group .
he should show some respect and not use such figures of speech .
question no 6 by ( h-0251 / 01 ) :
in order to avoid legal uncertainty and political confusion , would the president-in-office specify which elements the council considers binding and which not ' .
the union 's charter of fundamental rights has been signed by the european parliament , the council and the commission .
at this stage the three institutions have recognised the political value of the document within the union 's framework of action .
if the objective is to make existing rights more visible , however , certain of the rights that are proclaimed in the charter are already found in international conventions or in national constitutional traditions .
the fact that the rights have been formulated in the charter thus does not affect their value .
it was agreed that when this work has been carried out a new intergovernmental conference would be convened to discuss the status of the charter , amongst other things .
the minister will be aware that the court of justice is already deploying the charter quite broadly in its jurisprudence .
will he promise that the council will at least keep the impact of the charter closely under scrutiny and review its status on a continuing basis ?
the council has a duty to follow , discuss and monitor the question of the status of the charter .
this was decided by the european council in nice and obviously the council will abide by that decision .
allow me to remind you that the various articles of the charter are in part based on a number of rights taken from existing instruments .
the charter also contains a number of articles that are rather an expression of general political aims , for example articles 37 and 38 concerning environmental and consumer protection .
these are not designed in such a way as to be legally deployable immediately .
i should like to ask you if you agree with this kind of explanation or whether we european citizens have a right to greater protection by the european institutions .
the council is not in a position to judge the application in the particular case taken up by the member .
allow me to mention two things .
firstly : you stated that the charter has not been adopted .
the answer is that it has been solemnly proclaimed .
the member requests repetition .
i don ' t like repeating myself , but i am at parliament 's service .
allow me to explain as follows : from our viewpoint the charter is a political declaration and is only politically binding .
however , large parts of the content of the charter are already found in binding conventions , primarily the european convention on human rights .
the charter neither adds to nor detracts from these conventions in any way , but it is significant as clarification and as a political manifesto .
question no 7 by ( h-0252 / 01 ) :
two years later , in july 2000 , these six states signed the framework agreement on measures to facilitate structural change in the european defence industry and the ways in which it operates .
the honourable member of parliament raises the issue of what has been achieved as regards the declaration of intent and the framework agreement .
i understand the technicalities and thank the minister for that .
the council has not had opportunity to discuss this matter .
again , i am not in a position to be able to give any direct answer to the question put by the honourable member of parliament .
mr president , i often receive queries from citizens wishing to carry weapons in europe .
these people are hunters and marksmen travelling to competitions .
there are huge discrepancies in the rules here .
these are serious complaints and we are being asked why the internal market does not function in this area .
do you intend to take any initiatives here ?
no , we do not .
