Andorra
Andorra , officially the Principality of Andorra -LRB- -RRB- , also called the Principality of the Valleys of Andorra , is a small landlocked country in western Europe , located in the eastern Pyrenees mountains and bordered by Spain and France .
It is currently a prosperous country mainly because of tourism and its status as a tax haven .
The people of Andorra are currently listed as having the highest human life expectancy in the world , at an average of 85 years at birth .
Andorra is the sixth smallest nation in Europe .
Its name is thought to be derived from an ancient Basque tribe , the Andosinos , who are believed to have inhabited that region of the Pyrenees thousands of years ago .
History
Tradition holds that Charles the Great -LRB- Charlemagne -RRB- granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for fighting against the Moors .
Overlordship of the territory was of the local count of Urgell and eventually to the bishop of the diocese of Urgell .
In 988 Borrell II count of Urgell gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell when the count expanded to the south .
Since then the Bishop of Urgell , locally known as the bishop of the la Seu d'Urgell , has owned Andorra .
Andorra did not have any type of protection and the Bishop of Urgell , who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys , decided to ask for help and protection from the Lord of Caboet .
In 1095 , the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of la Seu d'Urgell signed under oath the recognition of their sovereignty over Andorra .
Arnalda , daughter of Arnau of Caboet , married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya .
Years later their daughter , Ermessenda , married Roger Bernat II of the French Count of Foix .
They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I Counts of Foix , Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya and also sovereigns of Andorra -LRB- shared with the Bishop of Urgell -RRB- .
In the eleventh century a dispute arose between the bishop of la Seu d'Urgell and Count of Foix .
The conflict was resolved in 1278 by the signing of the first paréage , with the mediation of Aragon , which provided that Andorra 's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix -LRB- whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state -RRB- and the bishop of Urgell , in Catalonia .
This gave the small principality its territory and political form .
Over the years the title passed to the kings of Navarre , and after Henry of Navarre became King Henry IV of France he issued an edict -LRB- 1607 -RRB- that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra .
In the period 1812–13 , the First French Empire annexed Catalonia and divided it in four départements .
Andorra was also annexed and made part of the district of Puigcerdà -LRB- département of Sègre -RRB- .
Andorra declared war on Imperial Germany during World War I but did not actually take part in the fighting .
It remained in an official state of belligerency until 1957 as it was not included in the Versailles Peace Treaty .
In 1933 France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections .
On July 12 , 1934 , an adventurer named Boris Skossyreff issued a proclamation in Urgell , declaring himself Boris I , sovereign prince of Andorra , simultaneously declaring war on the bishop of Urgell .
He was arrested by Spanish authorities on July 20 and ultimately expelled from Spain .
From 1936 to 1940 , a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the Spanish Civil War and Franco 's Spain .
Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war .
During World War II , Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between Vichy France and Spain .
Given its relative isolation , Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history , with few ties to countries other than France and Spain .
In recent times , however , its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transportation and communications have removed the country from its isolation .
Its political system was thoroughly modernized in 1993 , the year in which it became a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe .

Politics
Andorra is a parliamentary co-principality with the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell -LRB- Catalonia -RRB- , Spain , as co-princes , in a duumvirate .
The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy , whereby the Prime Minister of Andorra is the head of government , and of a multi-party system .
The current Prime Minister is Albert Pintat Santolària of the Andorran Liberal Party -LRB- PLA -RRB- .
Executive power is exercised by the government .
Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament .
The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council .
The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councilors , as the members of the legislative branch are called .
The Councilors serve for four-year terms and elections are held within the thirtieth and fortieth days following the dissolution of the previous Council .
The Councilors can be elected on two equal constituencies .
Half are elected in equal number from each of the seven administrative parishes and the other half of the Councilors are elected from a single national constituency .
Fifteen days following the election , the Councilors convene in their inaugural session .
During this session , the Syndic General , who is the head of the General Council , and the Subsyndic General , his assistant , are elected .
Eight days later , the Council convenes once more .
During this session the Head of Government , the Prime Minister of Andorra , is chosen from among the Councilors .
Candidates for nomination can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councilors .
The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government .
The Syndic General then notifies the Coprinces who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Prime Minister of Andorra .
The General Council also is responsible for proposing and passing laws .
Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members ' Bills by three of the Local Parish Councils jointly or one tenth of the citizens of Andorra .
The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality .
The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the current budget expires .
If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year , the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved .
Once any bill is approved , the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Coprinces so that they may sign and enact it .
If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council , he may request that the Coprinces dissolve the Council and order new elections .
In turn , the Councilors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office .
After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councilors , the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes , the Prime Minister is removed .
The Judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court , the Criminal Law Court , the High Court of Andorra , and the Constitutional Court .
The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges : one appointed by the Head of Government , one each by the Coprinces , one by the Syndic General , and one by the Judges and Magistrates .
It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms .
The Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court and so is the President of the Criminal Law Court .
The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General .
The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties .
The Court is composed of four judges , one appointed by each of the Coprinces and two by the General Council .
They serve eight-year terms .
The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two year rotation so that each judge at one point will be the leader of the Court .
Responsibility for defending Andorra rests with Spain and France .
Andorra currently has very limited nominal military force , used for ceremonial purposes only .
Parishes
Andorra consists of seven parishes :
Andorra la Vella
Canillo
Encamp
Escaldes-Engordany
La Massana
Ordino
Sant Julià de Lòria
Geography

Due to its location in the eastern Pyrenees mountain range , Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains of an average height of with the highest being the Coma Pedrosa at .
These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream , the Valira river , leaves the country for Spain -LRB- at Andorra 's lowest point of -RRB- .
Andorra 's surface area is .
Andorra 's climate is similar to that of its neighbours ' temperate climates , but its higher altitude means there is , on average , more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer .
Phytogeographically , Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom .
According to the WWF , the territory of Andorra belongs to the ecoregion of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests .
Economy

Tourism , the mainstay of Andorra 's tiny , well-to-do economy , accounts for roughly 80 % of GDP .
An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually , attracted by Andorra 's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts .
Andorra 's comparative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining France and Spain have been opened up , providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs .
The banking sector , with its tax haven status , also contributes substantially to the economy .
Agricultural production is limited—only 2 % of the land is arable—and most food has to be imported .
Some tobacco is grown locally .
The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising .
Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes , cigars , and furniture .
Andorra 's natural resources include hydroelectric power , mineral water , timber , iron ore , and lead .
Andorra is not a member of the European Union , but enjoys a special relationship with it , such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods -LRB- no tariffs -RRB- and as a non-EU member for agricultural products .
Andorra lacks a currency of its own and uses that of its two surrounding nations .
Prior to 2002 these were the French franc and the Spanish peseta , which have since been both replaced by the EU 's single currency , the euro .
Andorra is negotiating to issue its own euro coins .
Demographics
Andorrans , who are ethnically Catalans , are a minority in their own country ; Spaniards , Portuguese , French , Britons , and Italians make up 67.7 % of Andorra 's population .
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , Andorra has the world 's second longest life expectancy : 83.5 years .
Languages
The national language is Catalan , a Romance language .
Most Andorrans also speak Spanish , French or both .
Andorra is one of only four European countries -LRB- together with France , Monaco , and Turkey -RRB- that have never signed the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities .
Religion
The population of Andorra is predominantly Roman Catholic .
Their patron saint is Our Lady of Meritxell .
Culture
Andorran flag on balcony , Ordino
The official and historic language is Catalan .
Because of immigration , historical links , and close geographic proximity , other languages such as French , Portuguese and Spanish are also commonly spoken .
Andorra is home to folk dances like the contrapàs and marratxa , which survive in Sant Julià de Lòria especially .
Andorran folk music has similarities to the music of its neighbors , but is especially Catalan in character , especially in the presence of dances such as the sardana .
Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in Andorra la Vella and Saint Anne 's dance in Escaldes-Engordany .
Andorra 's national holiday is Our Lady of Meritxell Day , September 8 .

Animals (album)
Animals is a studio album by English progressive rock band Pink Floyd , released on 23 January 1977 in the United Kingdom and on 2 February 1977 in the United States .
The album proved to be a success in the UK , where it reached # 2 in the era of punk rock .
It was also a success in the U.S. , reaching # 3 on the Billboard album charts -LRB- # 1 and # 2 were Hotel California by The Eagles , and the soundtrack to the Barbra Streisand film A Star Is Born -RRB- .
Although it scored on the American charts for only six months , it has continued to sell solidly , and is now certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA .
Background
Animals is based approximately on George Orwell ` s political fable Animal Farm .
Various castes in society are represented as different types of animals -LRB- dogs as the businessmen , sheep as the powerless pawns , and pigs as the ruthless leaders -RRB- .
Although this album attacks Capitalism , in the book various animals -LRB- mainly pigs , sheep , dogs , etc. -RRB- represent different roles assumed by individuals in a Communist society .
David Gilmour and Roger Waters ` `` Dogs `` -LRB- which had the working title of `` You Gotta Be Crazy '' -RRB- and `` Raving and Drooling '' , a Waters song which would later become `` Sheep '' , were created at the same time as `` Shine On You Crazy Diamond `` , and originally intended for Wish You Were Here .
Their creation process was similar to the method the band used during the late 1960s and early 1970s .
They would adapt and expand their compositions by performing them live , and later in the studio find a more coherent form and concept for the whole album , with Waters writing the lyrics .
Animals was the last Pink Floyd album created in this way , as the subsequent The Wall and The Final Cut , were primarily conceived by Waters and worked out in the studio with some input from Gilmour .
Although Richard Wright did not contribute much compositionally , he had some influence on the arrangement of the songs , including solo playing on `` Dogs '' and `` Sheep '' .
As with `` Welcome to the Machine `` and `` Wish You Were Here `` on Wish You Were Here , Waters wrote `` Pigs on the Wing `` and `` Pigs -LRB- Three Different Ones -RRB- `` to harmonize the other songs conceptually .
His dominance in the writing credits and the discrepancy with the actual creation process is directly related to the increasing tensions within the band .
The three core songs are bookended by a pair of love songs written by Waters for his then-love Carolyne : `` Pigs on the Wing , Part 1 `` and `` Pigs on the Wing , Part 2 '' .
Both are in stark contrast to the misanthropic middle three songs , and suggest that companionship can help us overcome our flaws – though the final lines suggest that the singer is or was once one of the dogs .
For the 8-track cartridge release , which looped , Parts 1 and 2 were linked by a guitar bridge performed by Snowy White -LRB- subsequently available on White 's 1996 album `` Goldtop : Groups & Sessions '' -RRB- , and the 17 : 08 song `` Dogs '' was cut into two tracks .
This album represents the time during which it is generally claimed that Waters began to assert himself creatively on the rest of the band .
And while it is true that about 90 % of the album 's writing credits belong to Waters , the song that Gilmour shared half the credits for was almost half the album .
Speaking of Animals in an interview in the October 2008 edition of Mojo , Gilmour said , `` Roger 's thing is to dominate , but I am happy to stand up for myself and argue vociferously as to the merits of different pieces of music , which is what I did on Animals .
I didn't feel remotely squeezed out of that album .
Ninety per cent of the song ` Dogs ' was mine .
That song was almost the whole of one side , so that 's half of Animals. '' .
The giant , helium -filled pig -LRB- referred to as the Pink Floyd Pig -RRB- seen on the cover was actually flown over Battersea Power Station for the photo shoot under the direction of Storm Thorgerson .
On the first day of shooting , a marksman was on hand in case the pig broke free .
However , according to Thorgerson , this was considered an `` insurance problem '' , and he was not hired for the second day of shooting .
On 3 December 1976 , during the second day , a gust of wind broke the pig free of its moorings .
Because there was no one to shoot the pig down , it sailed away into the morning sky .
A police helicopter was sent up to track the pig , but was forced to return after following the pig to an altitude of 5,000 feet .
The CAA lost radar contact on the pig near Chatham in Kent , at a height of 18,000 feet and flying East .
It finally landed in a farmer 's field , without much damage .
They then repaired the pig , and flew it up for a third time .
The resulting pictures were not deemed suitable on their own -LRB- as the clear , blue sky from day three was thought to be much less evocative -RRB- , and the final image was made as a composite of the power station picture from day one and the pig from day three .
The album had custom picture labels , using drummer Nick Mason 's handwriting as a typeface , as did the lyrics on the liner sleeve .
Side one 's label depicted a fish-eye lens view of a dog and the English countryside .
Side two 's was similar , but featured a pig and sheep instead of the dog .
Originally released on Columbia Records in the U.S. and Harvest Records in the UK , Animals was then remastered in 1992 for its inclusion on the Shine On box set .
The remaster was subsequently released on its own by EMI in 1994 .
In 1997 , Columbia Records issued an updated remaster in the United States , Canada , Australia , South America and Japan .
Animals was again re-released in April 2000 by Capitol Records in the US , and on the EMI label in Japan , Canada , South America and Australia again using the 1992 Shine On remaster along with the artwork from the 1994 EMI Europe reissue .

Kirk Haston
Kirk Haston -LRB- born March 10 , 1979 in Lobelville , Tennessee -RRB- was an American professional basketball player .
He attended Perry County High School in Linden , Tennessee , where , as a senior , he was a part of the 37-0 Class A state championship team , being named Class A `` Mr. Basketball '' .
His college career took place under head coach Bob Knight and Mike Davis at Indiana University where , in the 2000-01 season he led the Big Ten in scoring and was a 3rd Team All-American selection .
Many nicknamed Kirk `` The Machine '' because he was so automatic in college .
During his sophomore year , he lost his mother , Patti Kirk Haston , 48 , in a tornado that hit the county seat , Linden , Tennessee on May 5 , 1999 .
Haston was selected 16th overall by the Charlotte Hornets in the 2001 NBA Draft ; many analysts , who had pegged Haston in the late first round-early second round area , thought that the Hornets took Haston to be a ` zone breaker ' , working against the change in rules that allowed some forms of the zone defense in games .
Haston was known for his sky hook shot and shooting range for a forward/center .
In two years he had many stints on the injury reserve list due to a lower back injury .
Haston averaged 1.2 points per game , playing in 27 games .
He also averaged one rebound per game while recording no steals .
He played the 2004-2005 season with the Florida Flame for head coach Dennis Johnson in the NBA D-League .
There he averaged 16 points , 7.9 rebounds , 1.2 blocks per game and was selected to the All NBDL First-Team .
His season came to an end when he suffered a right knee injury that required season-ending knee surgery with three games remaining .
In 2005 he signed with Upea Capo D'Orlando of the Serie A .
He and his wife Kasey soon returned from Sicily to Middle Tennessee when he was waived due to a right knee injury prior to the start of the season .

Antiparticle
Illustration of electric charge as well as general size of particles -LRB- left -RRB- and antiparticles -LRB- right -RRB- .
From top to bottom ; electron/positron , proton/antiproton , neutron/antineutron .
Corresponding to most kinds of particles , there is an associated antiparticle with the same mass and opposite electric charge .
For example , the antiparticle of the electron is the positively charged antielectron , or positron , which is produced naturally in certain types of radioactive decay .
The laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles .
For example , an antiproton and a positron can form an antihydrogen atom , which has almost exactly the same properties as a hydrogen atom .
A physicist whose body was made of antimatter , doing experiments in a laboratory also made of antimatter , using chemicals and substances comprised of antiparticles , would find almost exactly the same results in all experiments .
This leads to the question of why the formation of matter after the Big Bang resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter , rather than being a half-and-half mixture of matter and antimatter .
The discovery of CP violation helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry , originally thought to be perfect , was only approximate .
Particle-antiparticle pairs can annihilate each other , producing photons ; since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite , charge is conserved .
For example , the antielectrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons , producing pairs of gamma rays .
Antiparticles are produced naturally in beta decay , and in the interaction of cosmic rays in the Earth 's atmosphere .
Because charge is conserved , it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying a particle of the same charge -LRB- as in beta decay -RRB- , or creating a particle of the opposite charge .
The latter is seen in many processes in which both a particle and its antiparticle are created simultaneously , as in particle accelerators .
This is the inverse of the particle-antiparticle annihilation process .
Although particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges , electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles .
The neutron , for example , is made out of quarks , the antineutron from antiquarks , and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact .
However , other neutral particles are their own antiparticles , such as photons , the hypothetical gravitons , and WIMPs .
These are called Majorana particles and can annihilate with themselves .
History
Experiment
In 1932 , soon after the prediction of positrons by Paul Dirac , Carl D. Anderson found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a cloud chamber — a particle detector in which moving electrons -LRB- or positrons -RRB- leave behind trails as they move through the gas .
The electric charge-to-mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the curling of its cloud-chamber track in a magnetic field .
Originally , positrons , because of the direction that their paths curled , were mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction .
The antiproton and antineutron were found by Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain in 1955 at the University of California , Berkeley .
Since then the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments .
In recent years , complete atoms of antimatter have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons , collected in electromagnetic traps .
Hole theory
... the development of quantum field theory made the interpretation of antiparticles as holes unnecessary , even though it lingers on in many textbooks .
— Steven Weinberg in The quantum theory of fields , Vol I , p 14 , ISBN 0-521-55001-7
Solutions of the Dirac equation contained negative energy quantum states .
As a result , an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state .
Even worse , it could keep radiating infinite amount of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available .
To prevent this unphysical situation from happening , Dirac proposed that a `` sea '' of negative-energy electrons fills the universe , already occupying all of the lower energy states so that , due to the Pauli exclusion principle no other electron could fall into them .
Sometimes , however , one of these negative energy particles could be lifted out of this Dirac sea to become a positive energy particle .
But when lifted out , it would leave behind a hole in the sea which would act exactly like a positive energy electron with a reversed charge .
These he interpreted as the proton , and called his paper of 1930 A theory of electrons and protons .
Dirac was aware of the problem that his picture implied an infinite negative charge for the universe .
Dirac tried to argue that we would perceive this as the normal state of zero charge .
Another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton .
Dirac tried to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea , until Hermann Weyl proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges .
Dirac also predicted a reaction + → + , where an electron and a proton annihilate to give two photons .
Robert Oppenheimer and Igor Tamm proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast .
A year later , in 1931 , Dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron , a new particle of the same mass as the electron .
The discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory .
However , the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains .
Also , as we now know , bosons also have antiparticles , but since they do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle , hole theory doesn't work for them .
A unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in quantum field theory , which solves both these problems .
Particle-antiparticle annihilation
An example of a virtual pion pair which influences the propagation of a kaon causing a neutral kaon to mix with the antikaon .
This is an example of renormalization in quantum field theory — the field theory being necessary because the number of particles changes from one to two and back again .
If a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states , then they can annihilate each other and produce other particles .
Reactions such as + → + -LRB- the two-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair -RRB- is an example .
The single-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair , + → can not occur because it is impossible to conserve energy and momentum together in this process .
The reverse reaction is also impossible for this reason .
However , in quantum field theory this process is allowed as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the uncertainty principle .
This opens the way for virtual pair production or annihilation in which a one particle quantum state may fluctuate into a two particle state and back .
These processes are important in the vacuum state and renormalization of a quantum field theory .
It also opens the way for neutral particle mixing through processes such as the one pictured here : which is a complicated example of mass renormalization .
Properties of antiparticles
Quantum states of a particle and an antiparticle can be interchanged by applying the charge conjugation -LRB- C -RRB- , parity -LRB- P -RRB- , and time reversal -LRB- T -RRB- operators .
If |p , σ,n > denotes the quantum state of a particle -LRB- n -RRB- with momentum p , spin J whose component in the z-direction is σ , then one has
where nc denotes the charge conjugate state , i.e. , the antiparticle .
This behaviour under CPT is the same as the statement that the particle and its antiparticle lie in the same irreducible representation of the Poincare group .
Properties of antiparticles can be related to those of particles through this .
If T is a good symmetry of the dynamics , then
where the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side .
In other words , particle and antiparticle must have
the same mass m
the same spin state J
opposite electric charges q and -q .
Quantum field theory
This section draws upon the ideas , language and notation of canonical quantization of a quantum field theory .
One may try to quantize an electron field without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing
where we use the symbol k to denote the quantum numbers p and σ of the previous section and the sign of the energy , E -LRB- k -RRB- , and ak denotes the corresponding annihilation operators .
Of course , since we are dealing with fermions , we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti-commutation relations .
However , if one now writes down the Hamiltonian
then one sees immediately that the expectation value of H need not be positive .
This is because E -LRB- k -RRB- can have any sign whatsoever , and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0 .
So one has to introduce the charge conjugate antiparticle field , with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations
where k has the same p , and opposite σ and sign of the energy .
Then one can rewrite the field in the form
where the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy .
The energy becomes
where E0 is an infinite negative constant .
The vacuum state is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle , i.e. , and .
Then the energy of the vacuum is exactly E0 .
Since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum , H is positive definite .
Analysis of the properties of ak and bk shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles .
This is the case of a fermion .
This approach is due to Vladimir Fock , Wendell Furry and Robert Oppenheimer .
If one quantizes a real scalar field , then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator ; therefore real scalar fields describe neutral bosons .
Since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators , which are related by conjugation , such fields describe charged bosons .
The Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation
By considering the propagation of the negative energy modes of the electron field backward in time , Ernst Stueckelberg reached a pictorial understanding of the fact that the particle and antiparticle have equal mass m and spin J but opposite charges q .
This allowed him to rewrite perturbation theory precisely in the form of diagrams .
Richard Feynman later gave an independent systematic derivation of these diagrams from a particle formalism , and they are now called Feynman diagrams .
Each line of a diagram represents a particle propagating either backward or forward in time .
This technique is the most widespread method of computing amplitudes in quantum field theory today .
Since this picture was first developed by Ernst Stueckelberg , and acquired its modern form in Feynman 's work , it is called the Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation of antiparticles to honor both scientists .
