Animals is a studio album by English progressive rock band Pink Floyd , released on 23 January 1977 in the United Kingdom and on 2 February 1977 in the United States .
A police helicopter was sent up to track the pig , but was forced to return after following the pig to an altitude of 5,000 feet .
The CAA lost radar contact on the pig near Chatham in Kent , at a height of 18,000 feet and flying East .
The resulting pictures were not deemed suitable on their own -LRB- as the clear , blue sky from day three was thought to be much less evocative -RRB- , and the final image was made as a composite of the power station picture from day one and the pig from day three .

Corresponding to most kinds of particles , there is an associated antiparticle with the same mass and opposite electric charge .
If a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states , then they can annihilate each other and produce other particles .
History
Experiment
In 1932 , soon after the prediction of positrons by Paul Dirac , Carl D. Anderson found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a cloud chamber — a particle detector in which moving electrons -LRB- or positrons -RRB- leave behind trails as they move through the gas .
The electric charge-to-mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the curling of its cloud-chamber track in a magnetic field .
Originally , positrons , because of the direction that their paths curled , were mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction .
The antiproton and antineutron were found by Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain in 1955 at the University of California , Berkeley .
Since then the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments .
In recent years , complete atoms of antimatter have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons , collected in electromagnetic traps .
Hole theory
... the development of quantum field theory made the interpretation of antiparticles as holes unnecessary , even though it lingers on in many textbooks .

Solutions of the Dirac equation contained negative energy quantum states .
As a result , an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state .
Even worse , it could keep radiating infinite amount of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available .
To prevent this unphysical situation from happening , Dirac proposed that a `` sea '' of negative-energy electrons fills the universe , already occupying all of the lower energy states so that , due to the Pauli exclusion principle no other electron could fall into them .
Sometimes , however , one of these negative energy particles could be lifted out of this Dirac sea to become a positive energy particle .
But when lifted out , it would leave behind a hole in the sea which would act exactly like a positive energy electron with a reversed charge .
These he interpreted as the proton , and called his paper of 1930 A theory of electrons and protons .
Another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton .
Dirac tried to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea , until Hermann Weyl proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges .
Dirac also predicted a reaction + → + , where an electron and a proton annihilate to give two photons .
Robert Oppenheimer and Igor Tamm proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast .
A year later , in 1931 , Dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron , a new particle of the same mass as the electron .
The discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory .
However , the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains .
Also , as we now know , bosons also have antiparticles , but since they do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle , hole theory doesn't work for them .
A unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in quantum field theory , which solves both these problems .
Particle-antiparticle annihilation
If a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states , then they can annihilate each other and produce other particles .
The single-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair , + → can not occur because it is impossible to conserve energy and momentum together in this process .
The reverse reaction is also impossible for this reason .
However , in quantum field theory this process is allowed as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the uncertainty principle .
This opens the way for virtual pair production or annihilation in which a one particle quantum state may fluctuate into a two particle state and back .
These processes are important in the vacuum state and renormalization of a quantum field theory .
It also opens the way for neutral particle mixing through processes such as the one pictured here : which is a complicated example of mass renormalization .
Properties of antiparticles
Quantum states of a particle and an antiparticle can be interchanged by applying the charge conjugation -LRB- C -RRB- , parity -LRB- P -RRB- , and time reversal -LRB- T -RRB- operators .
If |p , σ,n > denotes the quantum state of a particle -LRB- n -RRB- with momentum p , spin J whose component in the z-direction is σ , then one has
where nc denotes the charge conjugate state , i.e. , the antiparticle .
This behaviour under CPT is the same as the statement that the particle and its antiparticle lie in the same irreducible representation of the Poincare group .
Properties of antiparticles can be related to those of particles through this .
If T is a good symmetry of the dynamics , then
where the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side .
In other words , particle and antiparticle must have
the same mass m
the same spin state J
opposite electric charges q and -q .
Quantum field theory
This section draws upon the ideas , language and notation of canonical quantization of a quantum field theory .
One may try to quantize an electron field without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing
where we use the symbol k to denote the quantum numbers p and σ of the previous section and the sign of the energy , E -LRB- k -RRB- , and ak denotes the corresponding annihilation operators .
Of course , since we are dealing with fermions , we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti-commutation relations .
However , if one now writes down the Hamiltonian
then one sees immediately that the expectation value of H need not be positive .
This is because E -LRB- k -RRB- can have any sign whatsoever , and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0 .
So one has to introduce the charge conjugate antiparticle field , with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations
where k has the same p , and opposite σ and sign of the energy .
Then one can rewrite the field in the form
where the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy .
The energy becomes
where E0 is an infinite negative constant .
The vacuum state is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle , i.e. , and .
Then the energy of the vacuum is exactly E0 .
Since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum , H is positive definite .
Analysis of the properties of ak and bk shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles .
This is the case of a fermion .
This approach is due to Vladimir Fock , Wendell Furry and Robert Oppenheimer .
If one quantizes a real scalar field , then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator ; therefore real scalar fields describe neutral bosons .
Since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators , which are related by conjugation , such fields describe charged bosons .

This technique is the most widespread method of computing amplitudes in quantum field theory today .
