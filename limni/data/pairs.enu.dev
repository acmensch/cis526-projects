Girl reading a Letter at an Open Window is a painting finished in 1657 by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer .
It is housed in the Gemäldegalerie of Dresden .
In this painting , a young woman stands in the center of the composition , facing in profile an open window to the left .
The picture was acquired in 1724 by August III , elector of Saxony , together with a number of other paintings bought in Paris .
In 1783 , it was engraved as a work by Govaert Flinck .
The name `` Van der Meer from Delft '' occurred for the first time in a catalog dating from 1806 , to be changed back to Flinck in 1817 .
From 1826 to 1860 , the appellation was altered to Pieter de Hooch .
It is only since 1862 that the correct identification obtains .
Tahiti is the largest island in the Windward group of French Polynesia , located in the archipelago of Society Islands in the southern Pacific Ocean .
History
Tahiti is estimated to have been settled between AD 300 and 800 by Polynesians , although some estimates place the date earlier .
The fertile soil combined with fishing provided food .
Although the first European sighting of the islands was by a Spanish ship in 1606 , Spain made no effort to trade with or colonise the island .
Samuel Wallis , an English sea captain , sighted Tahiti on 18 June , 1767 , and is considered the first European visitor .
The relaxed and contented nature of the people and the characterisation of the island as a paradise impressed early Europeans , planting the seed for a romanticisation by the West that endures to this day .
Wallis was followed in April 1768 by the French explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville , completing the first French circumnavigation .
Bougainville made Tahiti famous in Europe when he published Voyage autour du monde .
He described the island as an earthly paradise where men and women live happily in innocence , away from the corruption of civilization .
His account illustrated the concept of the noble savage , and influenced utopian thoughts of philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau before the French Revolution .
After Cook , European ships landed with greater frequency .
The best-known was HMS Bounty , whose crew mutinied after leaving Tahiti in 1789 .
The European influence disrupted traditional society , bringing prostitution , venereal disease , and alcohol .
Introduced diseases including typhus , influenza and smallpox killed so many Tahitians that by 1797 , the population was only 16,000 .
Later it was to drop as low as 6,000 .
In 1842 , a European crisis involving Morocco escalated between France and Great Britain when Admiral Dupetit Thouars , acting independently of the French government , convinced Tahiti 's Queen Pomare IV to accept a French protectorate .
George Pritchard , a Birmingham -born missionary and acting British Consul , had been away at the time .
However he returned to work towards indoctrinating the locals against the Roman Catholic French .
In November 1843 , Dupetit-Thouars -LRB- again on his own initiative -RRB- landed sailors on the island , annexing it to France .
He then threw Pritchard into prison , subsequently sending him back to Britain .
News of Tahiti reached Europe in early 1844 .
The French statesman François Guizot , supported by King Louis-Philippe of France , had denounced annexation of the island .
However , war between the French and the Tahitians continued until 1847 .
The island remained a French protectorate until June 29 , 1880 , when King Pomare V -LRB- 1842–1891 -RRB- was forced to cede the sovereignty of Tahiti and its dependencies to France .
In 1946 , Tahiti and the whole of French Polynesia became a Territoire d'outre-mer -LRB- French overseas territory -RRB- .
In 2003 , French Polynesia 's status was changed to that of Collectivité d'outre-mer -LRB- French overseas community -RRB- .
Tahitians are French citizens with nearly full civil and political rights .
The Tahitian language and the French language are both in use .
France 's influence is limited to subsidies , education and security .
The former President of French Polynesia , Oscar Temaru , advocates full independence from France , however , only about 20 % of the population is in favour .
During a press conference on June 26 , 2006 during the second France-Oceania Summit , French President Jacques Chirac said he did not think the majority of Tahitians wanted independence .
He would keep an open door to a possible referendum in the future .
In a surprise result , Oscar Temaru ` s pro-independence progressive coalition formed a Government with a one-seat majority in the 57-seat parliament , defeating the conservative party led by Gaston Flosse -LRB- see also List of political parties in French Polynesia -RRB- .
On October 8 , 2004 , Flosse succeeded in passing a censure motion against the Government , provoking a crisis .
A controversy is whether the national government of France should use its power to call for new elections in a local government in case of a political crisis .
French painter Paul Gauguin lived on Tahiti in the 1890s and painted many Tahitian subjects .
Tahiti hosts a French university , Université de la Polynésie Française -LRB- `` University of French Polynesia '' -RRB- .
Tourism is a significant industry , mostly to the islands of Bora Bora and Moorea .
In July , the Heiva festival in Papeete celebrates Polynesian culture and the commemoration of the storming of the Bastille in France .

The genus Aesculus -LRB- -RRB- , the buckeyes and Horse Chestnuts , comprises 13-19 species of woody trees and shrubs native to the temperate northern hemisphere , with 6 species native to North America and 7-13 species native to Eurasia ; there are also several hybrids .
This genus has traditionally been treated in the ditypic family Hippocastanaceae along with Billia , but recent phylogenetic analysis of morphological and molecular data has led to this family , along with the Aceraceae -LRB- Maples and Dipteronia -RRB- , being included in the soapberry family -LRB- Sapindaceae -RRB- .
Aesculus are woody plants from 4 to 36m tall -LRB- depending on species -RRB- , and have stout shoots with resinous , often sticky , buds ; opposite , palmately divided leaves , often very large -LRB- to 65 cm across in the Japanese Horse Chestnut Aesculus turbinata -RRB- .
Flowering starts after 80–110 growing degree days .
Uses
The nuts contain high concentrations of a saponin -class toxin called aesculin , which is toxic to many animals including humans because it causes hemolysis -LRB- destruction of red blood cells -RRB- .
The saponin can be eliminated by leaching the pulverized nuts in multiple changes of boiling water , to yield a wholesome starchy porridge once important to some Native American peoples .
Some animals , notably deer and squirrels , are resistant to the toxins and can eat the nuts directly .
In mathematics , especially order theory , a partially ordered set -LRB- or poset -RRB- formalizes the intuitive concept of an ordering , sequencing , or arrangement of the elements of a set .
Formal definition
A partial order is a binary relation `` ≤ '' over a set P which is reflexive , antisymmetric , and transitive , i.e. , for all a , b , and c in P , we have that :
a ≤ a -LRB- reflexivity -RRB- ;
if a ≤ b and b ≤ a then a = b -LRB- antisymmetry -RRB- ;
if a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c -LRB- transitivity -RRB- .
A set with a partial order is called a partially ordered set -LRB- also called a poset -RRB- .
The term ordered set is sometimes also used for posets , as long as it is clear from the context that no other kinds of orders are meant .
In particular , totally ordered sets can also be referred to as `` ordered sets '' , especially in areas where these structures are more common than posets .
Examples
The Hasse diagram of the set of all subsets of a three-element set -LCB- x , y , z -RCB- , ordered by inclusion .
The set of natural numbers equipped with the relation of divisibility .
The set of subsets of a given set -LRB- its power set -RRB- ordered by inclusion -LRB- see the figure on top-right -RRB- .
The set of subspaces of a vector space ordered by inclusion .
Strict and non-strict partial orders
In other words , asymmetric -LRB- hence irreflexive -RRB- and transitive .
Thus , for all a , b , and c in P , we have that :
¬ -LRB- a < a -RRB- -LRB- irreflexivity -RRB- ;
if a < b then ¬ -LRB- b < a -RRB- -LRB- asymmetry -RRB- ; and
if a < b and b < c then a < c -LRB- transitivity -RRB- .
Strict partial orders are useful because they correspond more directly to directed acyclic graphs -LRB- dags -RRB- : every strict partial order is a dag , and the transitive closure of a dag is both a strict partial order and also a dag itself .
Number of partial orders
Sequence -LSB- A001035 -RSB- in OEIS gives the number of partial orders on a set of n elements :
sequence -LSB- A001035 -RSB- in OEIS : number of partial orders on a set of n elements .
Linear extension
A total order T is a linear extension of a partial order P if , whenever x ≤ y in P it also holds that x ≤ y in T .

Pietro Pomponazzi -LRB- September 16 , 1462 – May 18 , 1525 -RRB- was an Italian philosopher .
Aury was born in Paris , France , in around 1788 .
He served in the French Navy , but from 1802 served in privateer ships .
By 1810 he had accumulated enough prize money to become the master of his own vessel .
He was then commissioned as `` Commodore of the Navy of New Grenada '' -LRB- Colombia -RRB- , and at great expense , evacuated hundreds of people from the besieged city of Cartagena , Colombia to Haiti .
He then accepted a commission from the fledgling Republic of Mexico as Civil and Military Governor of Texas , and established a privateering base on Galveston Island , Texas , in September 1816 .
However while Aury was away transporting Francisco Javier Mina and his men to Mexico , Jean Lafitte took control of the base at Galveston .
On 4 July 1818 he captured Old Providence Island -LRB- Isla de Providencia -RRB- in the western Caribbean , and began a settlement with a thriving economy based on captured Spanish cargo , while unsuccessfully trying to rebuild good relations with Bolivar .
He was thrown from a horse and killed in August 1821 , though some sources claim he was living in Havana in 1845 .
Aury attempts to liberate Central America
In order attempt to secure their independence , the Colombian insurgents fitted a combined sea and land expedition to operate against the ports of Omoa and Trujillo .
On the 21st of April -LRB- 1820 -RRB- the watch-tower at Capiro in Trujillo Port , announced the approach of a Colombian flotilla .
The port 's garrison , commanded by Jose M. Palomar , at once made preparations for emergencies during the impending attack .
The following day Commodore Aury moved the flotilla to the mouth of the Guaimoreto river and began bombardment .
A portion of the land force then attempted to enter the town by the rear , but was detected and driven out .
During the night of the 24th , the Colombian vessels dropped out of sight .
On the 25th the flotilla appeared off the port of Omoa and for several days attempted to land .
Commodore Aury was unsuccessful and left the area on the 6th of May .
Aury was perceived as a member of the Colombian fighters because of his affiliation with Simon Bolivar .
The 1936 Soviet constitution , adopted on December 5 , 1936 , and also known as the `` Stalin `` constitution , redesigned the government of the Soviet Union .
The constitution repealed restrictions on voting and added universal direct suffrage and the right to work to rights guaranteed by the previous constitution .
In addition , the Constitution recognized collective social and economic rights including the rights to work , rest and leisure , health protection , care in old age and sickness , housing , education , and cultural benefits .
The constitution also provided for the direct election of all government bodies and their reorganization into a single , uniform system .
Although the soviet propaganda said that the constitution was of Stalin ` s it was in fact written by a special commission including Nikolai Bukharin , Karl Radek and Yakov Yakovlev all of whom were executed in the Great Purge .
The 1936 constitution changed the name of the Central Executive Committee to the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics .
Like its predecessor , the Supreme Soviet contained two chambers : the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities .
The constitution empowered the Supreme Soviet to elect commissions , which performed most of the Supreme Soviet 's work .
As under the former constitution , the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet exercised the full powers of the Supreme Soviet between sessions and had the right to interpret laws .
The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet became the titular head of state .
The Sovnarkom -LRB- after 1946 known as the Council of Ministers -RRB- continued to act as the executive arm of the government .
Of the four Soviet constitutions , the 1936 constitution survived longest .
The constitution provided economic rights not included in constitutions in the western democracies .
The constitution was seen as a personal triumph for Stalin , who on this occasion was described by Pravda as `` genius of the new world , the wisest man of the epoch , the great leader of communism . ''
Western historians and historians from former Soviet occupied countries have seen the constitution as a meaningless propaganda document .
Leonard Schapiro , for example , writes that `` The decision to alter the electoral system from indirect to direct election , from a limited to a universal franchise , and from open to secret voting , was a measure of the confidence of the party in its ability to ensure the return of candidates of its own choice without the restrictions formerly considered necessary , '' and that `` ... a careful scrutiny of the draft of the new constitution showed that it left the party 's supreme position unimpaired , and was therefore worthless as a guarantee of individual rights .

History
Before Terrytoons
Terry first worked for Bray Studios in 1916 , where he created the Farmer Al Falfa series .
He then would then make a Farmer Al Falfa short for Edison Pictures , called `` Farmer Al Falfa 's Wayward Pup '' -LRB- 1917 -RRB- , and some later cartoons were made for Paramount Pictures .
Circa 1921 , Terry founded the Fables animation studio , named for its Aesop 's Film Fables series , in conjunction with Amadee J. Van Beuren .
Fables churned out a Fable cartoon every week for eight years in the 1920s .
Terry refused , and Van Beuren fired him in 1929 .
Almost immediately , Terry and much of his staff started up the Terrytoons studio .
Through much of its history , the studio was considered one of the lowest-quality houses in the field , to the point where Paul Terry noted , `` Disney is the Tiffany 's in this business , and I am the Woolworth 's . ''
Terry 's studio had the lowest budgets and was among the slowest to adapt to new technologies such as sound -LRB- in about 1930 -RRB- and Technicolor -LRB- in 1942 -RRB- , while its graphic style remained remarkably static for decades .
Changing hands
The following year , CBS put it under the management of UPA alumnus Gene Deitch , who had to work with even lower budgets .
Deitch 's most notable works at the studio were the Tom Terrific cartoon segments for the Captain Kangaroo television show .
He also introduced a number of new characters , such as Sick Sick Sidney , Gaston Le Crayon , John Doormat , and Clint Clobber .
Deitch brought much creativity and life to the Terrytoons cartoons , but because he was the new man at the studio , he wasn't entirely welcome .
An internal battle was fought by studio stalwarts and Deitch was forced out .
After Deitch was fired in 1958 , Bill Weiss took control of the studio .
Under his supervision , Heckle and Jeckle and Mighty Mouse went back into production .
In addition , the studio began producing the Deputy Dawg series for television in 1960 .
The most notable talent at Terrytoons in the 1960s was animator/director/producer Ralph Bakshi , who got his start with Terrytoons in the 1950s and later helmed the Mighty Heroes series .
Bakshi would later go on to produce Mighty Mouse : The New Adventures for television in 1987 .
Post-history
After the departure of Bakshi after 1966 , the studio petered out and finally closed in 1968 .
However , the film library was still regularly rereleased to theatres by Fox .
Fortunately for the studio , its existing cartoon library saw a long life in TV reruns .
The Terrytoons cartoons -LRB- especially Mighty Mouse and Deputy Dawg -RRB- were syndicated to many local TV markets , and they were a staple of after-school and Saturday morning cartoon shows for over three decades , from the 1950s through the 1980s , until the television rights to the library were acquired by USA Network in 1989 .
In the 1970s , the CBS Films properties were spun off to create Viacom , which itself re-merged with CBS in 1999 .
In the late 70 's , Filmation Studios licensed the rights in order to make a new Mighty Mouse series .
Later in 1987 , Ralph Bakshi produced Mighty Mouse : The New Adventures which lasted for two seasons .
Bakshi and John Kricfalusi inspired the staff to try to get as much Jim Tyer style drawing in the show .
Tyer , a stand-out Terry animator of the original cartoons with a unique style , became a strong influence on the artists of the Bakshi series .
A brand-new feature-length animated film featuring Terrytoons is now in development by Paramount and Nickelodeon Movies .

Gethen 's axis is not tilted -LRB- as is the case with Earth -RRB- , but a relatively high orbital eccentricity produces global seasons .
At the time of the story , Gethen is in the midst of an Ice Age -LRB- some local scientists believe it is near the end -RRB- .
The poles and a large portion of the land around them are permanently covered with glaciers , and even in the inhabited areas the climate can be extremely cold .
In some places it is impossible to travel in winter , since the snow covers all roads .
A summer day at 30 degrees Celsius is compared -LRB- by a Gethenian -RRB- to being inside a furnace .
Gethenians are physically and culturally adapted to cold ; they tend to be of robust build and short stature , and they are familiar with the caloric yield of many different types of food .
-LRB- The physical adaptations might be a product of genetic manipulation by the Hain , the species that `` seeded '' many worlds in the Ekumen with humanoid lifeforms . -RRB-
The inhabitants of Gethen are androgynes , biologically hermaphroditic humans ; for approximately three weeks of each month they are biologically neuter , and for the remaining week are male or female , as determined by pheromonal negotiation with an interested sex partner .
Thus each individual can both sire and bear children .
Gethen orbits its primary star once every 0.96 Earth years -LRB- 8401 Earth hours -RRB- .
The planet rotates around its axis in 23.08 earth hours , so a Gethenian year consists of 364 local days .
The only natural satellite of the planet revolves around it in 26 local days , which constitutes a month .
The year is divided into 14 of these lunar months .
By fortunate coincidence , the deviation between this lunisolar calendar and the true solar year is small enough to require a correction only once every 200 years .
Each day in a month has a unique name .
Gethenians further divide each day into ten parts or `` hours '' , the first one starting at noon .
Historical records employ well-known events to mark -LRB- fixed -RRB- past dates .
Cartography
Gethen has four continents and an archipelago .
Two of the continents , Orgoreyn and Karhide , are connected .
The action of the novel takes place here .
The other continents are Sith and the Antarctic continent , Perunter .
The planet is covered with ice everywhere beyond 45 degrees , and often down to 30 degrees .
