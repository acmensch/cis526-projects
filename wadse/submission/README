This directory contains two files:

 - alignments: the true alignments for the test data.
   These are in alphabetical order (bg, de, es)

 - grade: takes in submission through stdin and calculates
   the displays the F1 score for the submission. Once again,
   the submission must be in the order bg, de, es.

Usage: (assuming submission is in assignment5.txt)
cat assignment5.txt | ./grade
