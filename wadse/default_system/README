In each of the data directories (de, bg, es), there are the following files:
 - for both train and test:
   - _e: English Wikipedia entries
   - _f: Foreign Wikipedia entries
   - _a: Alignments between these articles (hand-aligned)
 - europarl_e, europarl_f: 10000 aligned sentences from Europarl corpus

In this directory, there are four scripts:
 - generate_features: 
   generates a features file with the following output:
     article number, alignment, binary hand-aligned indicator, features
 - learn: 
   using the features just generated, produce a weight file to be used for
   alignment.
 - align:
   Using the feature file generated by generate_features, assign a score to 
   each possible sentence alignment. For each foreign sentence, choose the 
   one best English sentence; if the score is above a certain threshold, 
   include this alignment in the output
  -grade: 
   grade the output from align using the hand-aligned sentences

A final script, align_test.sh, is included for ease of use.
Submissions must be alignments for all test data, in the order
bg, de, es; this script makes it easy.

Example usage:
# to generate weights (training) for one language
./generate_features es
./learn es
./align es | ./grade es
# to create submission file. Repeat first step for all langauages
./generate_features -t test es
./align_test.sh > assignment5.txt

Note that the only input necessary for each script is the directory (langauge).
All other inputs have default values, but can be changed - see the -h flag for help.

Attribution: I used some of the baseline code from assignment 1 to generate
             the dice coefficient in generate_features, and a SVM similar to
             the one in assignment 4 for learning.
