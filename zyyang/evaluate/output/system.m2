Technology , no matter if it was developed via research or via serendipity , was scientists greatest contribution to the world .
This lead to factors such as a limited pool of local talents , a small local market and a lack of volunteers willing to try out new innovations ; all of which will affect the engineering design process .
For example , a person can lead his life peacefully without a laptop or hand phone , but , can a person survive happily with the absence of good health ?
So in this way , the refrigerator is shaped by the potential profitability of its producer .
