Translation Models

{hansard, emea}_grammar.gz
  These are text-based grammar files for the Hansard training data and the EMEA training data.

{hansard, emea}_grammar.packed
  These are packed grammars; they are encoded in way that makes it much faster for the Joshua decoder to read the grammar rules. This makes it more efficient than the text-based grammars, but harder to work with if you want to alter the entries in the grammar.

The script in $JOSHUA/scripts/support/grammar-packer.pl can be used to convert a text-based grammar into a packed grammar. 

grammar.glue
  This is a special grammar that is used in decoding. 

********************************
Language Models

{hansard, emea}_lm.gz
  These are language models in ARPA format (see http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/manpages/ngram-format.5.html for details).

{hansard, emea}_lm.kenlm
  These are language models in KenLM's compiled format. This format is loaded more quickly, but it is not in human-readable format.


The $JOSHUA/bin/build_binary script can be used to convert the ARPA format to KenLM format.
