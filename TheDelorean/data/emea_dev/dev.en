transdermal use
The CHMP considers that the criteria of the guideline on transdermal dosage forms - CPMP/ EWP/ 280/ 96- (i. e. exact proportionality of the formulation and acceptable in vitro release test) were met with the fentanyl ratiopharm transdermal patch as well as with the reference medicinal product.
It is advised not to use fentanyl during labour and delivery (including caesarean section) since fentanyl passes the placenta and may cause respiratory depression in the new born infant.
The dose should be titrated individually until analgesic efficacy is attained.
Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic which interacts predominantly with the µ-receptor.
Therefore patients who develop fever should be monitored for opioid adverse reactions.
