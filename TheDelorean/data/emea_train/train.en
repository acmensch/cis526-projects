Oral use
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.

Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see section 4.5).
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Hypersensitivity: as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).

In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy subjects, the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean Cmax values was 122% (N = 30).
However, in a single-dose, intramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone.

In patients not adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at trough of 7-10/ 3-6 mm Hg (systolic/ diastolic).
As with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in serum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function.
In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/ kg/ day in rats and ≥ 100 mg/ kg/ day in macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit).

In patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in order to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.
Aranesp 15 micrograms solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe.
Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100)
Guidance is given separately for adult and paediatric patients.
The therapeutic margin of Aranesp is very wide.
Dose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every two weeks.
In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions.
When substituting Aranesp for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration should be used.
Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/ hr/ kg (SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/ kg).
Therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) or below.
Placental transfer was minimal.
In clinical studies, an increased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Do not administer more than one dose per syringe.

Vascular disorders
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided.
• Convulsions.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Aranesp is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Clinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered as a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any increase in total dose requirements.
Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing with Aranesp should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Aranesp therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy.
These included myelofibrosis and splenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and no effect on the QT interval were observed.
Active liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Aranesp, therefore no data are available from patients with impaired liver function.

Improvement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue (FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed.
If a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that the dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.
Following monthly administration of darbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 µg/ kg, the terminal half-life was 73 hours (SD 24).
Therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) or below.
In studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed.
The needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions.

Common
The efficacy of duloxetine 40 mg given twice daily in the treatment of SUI was established in four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, that randomised 1913 women (22 to 83 years) with SUI; of these, 958 patients were randomised to duloxetine and 955 to placebo.
Generally the symptoms are mild to moderate, however, in some patients they may be severe in intensity.
Investigations
The disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least 12-weeks postpartum.
The most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain treated with ARICLAIM were: nausea; headache, dry mouth and somnolence.
Female rats receiving duloxetine (45 mg/ kg/ day) before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at the most at maximum clinical exposure (AUC).

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 to 50 hours.

32 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
When duloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold.
Duloxetine binds to both albumin and alpha-l acid glycoprotein.
Oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce the catalytic activity of CYP3A.
Duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative enzymes (CYP1A2 and the polymorphic CYP2D6), followed by conjugation.

Subcutaneous use
Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders
In one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children experienced an infection while receiving Enbrel during 3 months of the study (part 1 open-label), and the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of open-label extension therapy.
Patients currently on methotrexate therapy (stable for  2 months) could continue at a stable dose of  25 mg/ week methotrexate.
A biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept.
Thus the combined use of Enbrel and anakinra is not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).
There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes.
In part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2.
The proportion of subjects who developed antibodies to etanercept in longer-term trials (of up to 3.5 years) increases over time, as expected.
Caution should be exercised when administering Enbrel to patients identified as carriers of HBV.
Of the rheumatoid arthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed new positive ANA ( 1:40) was higher in patients treated with Enbrel (11%) than in placebo-treated patients (5%).
In this study, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg Enbrel once weekly and 153 patients received 25 mg Enbrel twice weekly.

This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history of tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/ or current immunosuppressive therapy.

In this study, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg Enbrel once weekly and 153 patients received 25 mg Enbrel twice weekly.
In a long-term psoriasis study in which patients received 50 mg twice weekly for 96 weeks, the incidence of antibodies observed at each assessment point was up to approximately 9%.

Clinical symptoms and signs of mild ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome are abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, and mild to moderate enlargement of ovaries and ovarian cysts.
Such patients are unresponsive to Fertavid/ hCG therapy. • In men, semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
Treatment of women:
Gynaecomastia and acne may occur occasionally during Fertavid/ hCG therapy.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Fertavid contains a recombinant FSH.
FSH is indispensable in normal follicular growth and maturation, and gonadal steroid production.
Treatment with Fertavid is generally followed by administration of hCG to induce the final phase of follicle maturation, resumption of meiosis and rupture of the follicle.

Irbesartan/ hydrochlorothiazide combination:
The following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/ hydrochlorothiazide combination at 10/ 10 and 90/ 90 mg/ kg/ day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products alone and/ or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions were observed): kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and hyperplasia/ hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the interaction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in a 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/ kg/ day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/ kg/ day, and irbesartan/ hydrochlorothiazide 10/ 10 mg/ kg/ day.
Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol;
Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% protein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/ kg.
Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 300 mg irbesartan/ 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely administered with other antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers.
When assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours period with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/ diastolic reductions of 15.8/ 10.0 mm Hg.

Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, haemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis may also compromise the erythropoietic response.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.21 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.45 mmol/ l).
Once removed from the refrigerator the medicinal product must be used within this period.
Patients were randomized to stay on their treatment at the time of enrollment or to be switched to MIRCERA in order to maintain stable haemoglobin levels.
Lactation:

1 ml (one vial) contains 600 micrograms of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta*.
In a single dose study, after intravenous administration, the pharmacokinetics of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta are similar in patients with severe hepatic impairment as compared to healthy subjects (see section 4.2).
During treatment with MIRCERA, a slight decrease in platelet counts remaining within the normal range was observed in clinical studies.
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Patients not currently treated with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA):
The sterile pre-filled syringe does not contain any preservative and is to be used for a single injection only.
Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.
MIRCERA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
After dose interruption a haemoglobin decrease of approximately 0.35 g/ dl (0.22 mmol/ l) per week is expected.
For more information, see section 5.1.
In a six-month rat toxicity study no tumorigenic or unexpected mitogenic responses were observed in non-haematological tissues.
Overdose can result in manifestations of an exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect, e. g. excessive erythropoiesis.
MIRCERA, like other ESAs, is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production.
After dose interruption a haemoglobin decrease of approximately 0.35 g/ dl (0.22 mmol/ l) per week is expected.
7.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.

4.2 Posology and method of administration
6.2 Incompatibilities
Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, the active substance of MIRCERA, is a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator that shows a different activity at the receptor level characterized by a slower association to and faster dissociation from the receptor, a reduced specific activity in vitro with an increased activity in vivo, as well as an increased half-life, in contrast to erythropoietin.

The concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60%.
In some cases, a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor.
In addition, a SPECT imaging study in schizophrenic patients revealed that olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other antipsychotic- and risperidone-responsive patients, while being comparable to clozapine-responsive patients.
As it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism, olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists.
The pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly.
The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52% and 108% respectively.
In monkeys, single oral doses up to 100 mg/ kg resulted in prostration and, at higher doses, semi-consciousness.

Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline (≥ 4.39 - < 5.17 mmol/ l) to high (≥ 5.17 mmol/ l) were very common.
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia).
In patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium (divalproex) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
In non-smoking versus smoking subjects (males and females) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged (38.6 versus 30.4 hr) and the clearance was reduced (18.6 versus 27.7 l/ hr).

Concomitant use of Puregon and clomifene citrate may enhance the follicular response.
These antibiotics may cause hypersensitivity reactions in susceptible persons. • Elevated endogeneous FSH levels in men are indicative of primary testicular failure.
It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumours in infertile women. • Women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombosis, such as a personal or family history, severe obesity (Body Mass Index > 30 kg/ m2) or thrombophilia, may have an increased risk of venous or arterial thrombo-embolic events, during or following treatment with gonadotrophins.
This is characterised by large ovarian cysts (prone to rupture), ascites, often hydrothorax and weight gain.
In rare instances, venous or arterial thromboembolism may occur in association with OHSS. • There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.
Concomitant use of Puregon and clomifene citrate may enhance the follicular response.
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported.
4.8 Undesirable effects
In approximately 4% of the women treated with Puregon in clinical trials, signs and symptoms related to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) have been reported (see section 4.4).

The most common side effects with Rapamune (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are urinary tract infection (infection of the structures that carry urine), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), hypokalaemia (low blood potassium levels), hypophosphataemia (low blood phosphate levels), hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol levels), hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), hypertriglyceridaemia (high blood levels of triglycerides, a type of fat), headache, lymphocele (fluid collection around the kidney), hypertension (high blood pressure), abdominal (tummy) pain, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea (feeling sick), acne (spots), arthralgia (joint pain), peripheral oedema (swelling, usually in the legs), pyrexia (fever), pain, increased blood lactate dehydrogenase levels (a marker of tissue breakdown) and increased blood creatinine levels (a marker of kidney problems).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Rapamune oral solution contains polysorbate-80, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
Multiple-dose administration of verapamil and sirolimus oral solution significantly affected the rate and extent of absorption of both drugs.
These data indicate that younger children might require higher bodyweight-adjusted doses than adolescents and adults to achieve similar target concentrations.
Patients treated with ciclosporin and Rapamune beyond 3 months had higher serum creatinine levels and lower calculated glomerular filtration rates compared to patients treated with ciclosporin and placebo or azathioprine controls.
At 2 years, the rate of non-melanoma skin malignancies was significantly lower in the Rapamune conversion group as compared to the calcineurin inhibitors continuation group (1.8% and 6.9%).

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Alternatively, Retacrit can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
In some pre-clinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, erythropoietin therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.

In this study, the dose of Revatio started at 20 mg three times a day, and was increased to 40 mg and then to 80 mg at weeks 4 and 8.
Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/ cGMP pathway (see section 5.1), sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its co-administration with nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3).
In pups of rats which were pre- and postnatally treated with 60 mg/ kg sildenafil, a decreased litter size, a lower pup weight on day 1 and a decreased 4-day survival were seen at exposures which were approximately fifty times the expected human exposure at 20 mg three times a day.
