that is why our assessment is critical and we think the results are poor .
mr president , in my view the emphasis at the stockholm summit lay on developing the internal market , in other words on economic liberalisation as stated earlier .
the social issues , particularly the question of unemployment , were hardly touched upon .
göran persson , it was the intention that the meeting was to focus on employment and employment policy .
however , there are two different forms of employment policy .
the first is about increasing provision on the labour market by increasing the labour force , i.e. increasing the employment rate .
the second is about reducing the number of unemployed .
these are two different areas of policy .
in stockholm you devoted yourselves to expanding the labour force by adding new groups to the labour market .
this was to be achieved by reducing the number of women at home in europe and by retaining the elderly on the labour market for a few more years .
i have nothing against measures to increase the available workforce but no one can claim that they provide any direct benefit for the unemployed .
in fact it is rather the reverse , such that the 14 - 15 million people who are unemployed face increasing competition for jobs by the addition of new groups at the same time as wage-related pressures increase .
cutting working hours would also benefit all those who are already in work and make it easier for them to combine work and family life .
i would like to see actual measures for the unemployed .
it is not yet too late as the swedish presidency still has a few months left to run .
i would like to see measures specifically focused on those who are unemployed and which help them here and now .
mr president , i have listened with great interest to the words of the president of the commission - moreover , the press was informative on the matter - and i would like to clarify one point .
president prodi has rightly stressed that the glass is half full and half empty , that some results have been achieved , but not all .
he is right .
the issues of energy , liberalisation of energy and the european patent are fundamental .
mr president , a political paradox of the highest order .
this is how we can best describe the signing of the stabilisation and association agreement between the european union and macedonia this coming monday in luxembourg .
this is evident from the continuing efforts by both parties to prevent an ethnic division of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , fyrom .
we need to see europe 's wish in that light , namely the wish for the leaders of all parties represented in the macedonian parliament - including slavonic and albanian macedonians , therefore - to grace that ceremony with their presence .
the symbolism is crystal clear .
in that way , macedonia 's entire political forum would demonstrate that it is choosing to walk a peaceful , european course .
is this symbolism , employed by europe , misleading and , therefore , dangerous ?
the european council 's lucid explanation in stockholm seems to contradict this negative interpretation .
this applies equally to the busy shuttle diplomacy on the part of mr solana and mr patten vis- \ xc3 -vis macedonia and kosovo .
the role of nato in this european policy on crisis management is unmistakable .
however , this encouraging note is not in accordance with the press information i received yesterday .
according to that press report , however , only three countries have apparently responded to mr patten 's request .
if europe is to make every effort to prevent a yugoslavian scenario in macedonia , european and american levers will really need to be deployed to the best possible effect .
mr president , in economic and social terms , the stockholm council set itself a major strategic objective : to define the main conditions necessary in order to turn europe into a competitive area with full employment .
yet the council 's conclusions give a rather odd double impression of unrestrained intervention on the one hand and abstention on the other .
as far as multidirectional interventions are concerned , there is hardly any subject in the economic and social field which has not been mentioned , even when there was nothing new to say about it .
this makes it hard to identify the main thrusts , and in particular it is no longer possible to distinguish between what is europe 's responsibility and what is the member states ' responsibility .
for example , the stockholm council was very concerned about the viability of social protection systems , a subject which the previous council , in nice , had expressly designated as being the responsibility of the member states .
one only has to mention , somewhere in a sentence , the need to respect subsidiarity , and the machine can rumble on its way as if nothing had happened .
this omnipresent method raises not only the question of subsidiarity , but also the question of how effective the work of the council actually is .
we very much doubt whether the heads of state or government were really able to examine all these subjects , and we very much doubt whether it is possible to make things happen by using such methods .
there is also no mention of the commission 's recent communication on this subject , which seems to have been put aside .
however , if the euro does not recover , mr president , its credibility in the eyes of the public will be called into question .
stockholm was like a mini nice , without the squabbles .
nobody wanted to speak up for the european common good , and most governments clung to their own interests , such as they imagined them to be .
that is what happened , despite what was certainly an enormous effort to achieve results on the part of the country to hold the presidency .
at the beginning of the year someone joked that the aims of lisbon had become the promises of nikita khrushchev .
it was he who said at the start of the 1960s that the soviet union would overtake the united states in ten years in terms of economic power .
in the wake of the stockholm meeting , there is going to be a grain of truth in that joke .
i would nonetheless like to mention one positive decision that was taken at stockholm .
at last a nugget of something concrete has been found for a policy on the northern dimension .
och på svenska : sverige är alltid välkommen i klubben . -lsb- and in swedish : sweden is always welcome to join the club . -rsb-
mr president , on behalf of the socialist group , i would like to say a few words on the foreign policy decisions taken in stockholm .
last weekend , we all witnessed the television reports and the tension surrounding former president milosevic 's arrest .
our group , undoubtedly like many others here , welcomes this arrest with open arms .
we also have a great deal of respect for the way in which the authorities of the former republic of yugoslavia handled this matter .
it must have been an extremely difficult situation to deal with .
there was a great deal of tangible tension .
the fact that this step was ultimately taken indicates that another move has been made towards more integration within our law-based community , also here in europe .
at the same time , our wish remains , of course , to ultimately see mr milosevic brought before the international war tribunal in the hague .
we assume , as before , that the european union will keep the pressure on in that respect and that the international war tribunal will ultimately be the place where he will face his final reckoning .
at the same time , we have seen a great deal of tension , probably more than some of us had expected , in fyrom 's border regions .
needless to say , the early warning systems are still not fully functioning .
we probably could have reacted more promptly in a number of areas .
the consultation structures are not yet completely in place either , but we certainly have more tools at our disposal than before .
we are better able to operate in those regions , and we are seeing the first signs of a common foreign policy , something which we would very much like to promote further .
once again , the association agreement too could be an excellent tool in this respect .
here in parliament , we are ready to adopt this agreement as quickly as possible , and we want to encourage everything which can make progress possible in this respect .
with regard to the middle east , the ministers perez and nabil shaath of the palestinian authority are supposed to meet in athens today .
the un resolutions , the oslo agreements : it is as if some things no longer exist , and both parties operate in a very irresponsible manner .
we hope that moratinos , our representative , in conjunction with mr solana and the swedish presidency , succeed at least in bringing those parties around the negotiating table once more , for there is no other alternative .
this brings me to my third point .
we are pleased that the swedish presidency has managed to bring the northern dimensions as a whole back to the fore once again .
st petersburg has been mentioned .
this is a crucial point for us .
you have relations and contacts there which provide extra opportunities .
which brings me to my final point .
the swedish presidency has , traditionally , always played a very clear role , not as the swedish presidency , but as sweden in the un security council .
it is evident that during the bush administration , the cowards of this world threaten to change their course again .
it is important that europe in this respect - mr barón crespo has actually said this on behalf of our group - adopt its own , self-assured role .
not so much an anti-stance : we should not fall back on old patterns .
it is a ' global village ' , and we rely on global partnership .
in that respect , a unilateral withdrawal from kyoto can not be accepted .
this is also true of the unilateral withdrawal of the united states in other respects , such as in the field of rocket defence systems .
mr president , i would like to begin by congratulating the president of the council on a successful summit in stockholm .
i believe that many swedes were delighted to see their country finally being able to act as host to the leaders of the eu .
stockholm was supposed to be about the creation of a competitive europe .
it was supposed to be about action , not eu rhetoric , but was that the case ?
no , unfortunately not enough , as the president of the council himself has admitted .
reform of the eu is going too slowly .
it was unfortunate that those in stockholm were unable to agree on a timetable for deregulation of the energy markets .
on the other hand , they did succeed in agreeing to create a common financial market , which has been eagerly awaited .
we liberals now assume that the council is prepared to act such that we achieve a solution which can also be accepted by parliament .
mr president , this is about democratic support and openness .
the swedish presidency has an overall vision of bringing the union closer to its citizens .
this is an excellent ambition .
finally , i would like to point out we are now halfway through the swedish presidency .
one issue is becoming ever clearer : - it is becoming more and more problematic for sweden to remain outside the emu .
i am not seeking an answer in terms of domestic policy but a theoretical opinion from an eu perspective .
mr president , i welcome the statement that future spring summits are going to be sustainability summits , and thank the swedish presidency for their real leadership on this .
