Ottawa
Ottawa -LRB- or sometimes -RRB- is the capital of Canada and a municipality within the Province of Ontario .
Located in the Ottawa Valley in the eastern portion of Southern Ontario , the city lies on the southern banks of the Ottawa River , a major waterway forming the local boundary between the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec .
The 2006 Census recorded the population at over 812,000 , making it the fourth largest municipality in the country and second largest in Ontario .
Connected by several bridges to its Quebec neighbour , the City of Gatineau on the northern shores of the Ottawa River , the two cities had a combined 2006 population of over 1,130,000 , making it the country 's fourth largest metropolitan area .
Ottawa is governed by a 24-member city council consisting of 23 councillors each representing one ward and the mayor , elected at-large .
As a single tier municipality , Ottawa has responsibility for all municipal services , including fire , ambulance , police , parks , roads , sidewalks , public transit , drinking water , stormwater , sanitary sewage and solid waste .
There is no federal capital district in Canada .
Although it does not constitute a separate administrative district , Ottawa is part of the federally designated National Capital Region -LRB- NCR -RRB- , which encompasses Ottawa , Gatineau and surroundings areas having a population of over 1,451,000 .
The National Capital Commission is a federal crown corporation charged with the responsibility of plannng and managing the federal government 's interests in the NCR .
As with other national capitals , the word `` Ottawa '' is also used to refer by metonymy to the country 's federal government , especially as opposed to provincial or municipal authorities .
History

ChaudiÃ¨re Falls before damming and the construction of mills at this part of the river .
The Ottawa region was long home to the Odawa or Odaawaa First Nations people .
The Odawa are an Algonquin people who called the river the Kichi Sibi or Kichissippi , unrelated to Mississippi , meaning `` Great River '' .
The Algonquin people never relinquished any land claims to the Government of Canada .
In 2008 the Algonquins made a land claim to the federal government asserting that they have ownership to the Ottawa River watershed in Ontario and its natural resources .
The first European settlement in the region was that of Philemon Wright who started a community on the Quebec side of the river in 1800 .
Wright discovered that transporting timber by river from the Ottawa Valley to Montreal was possible , and the area was soon booming based almost exclusively upon the timber trade .
Liked by many European nations for its extremely straight and strong trunk , the White Pine was found throughout the valley .
In the years following the War of 1812 , in addition to settling some military regiment families , the government began sponsored immigration schemes which brought over Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants to settle the Ottawa area , which began a steady stream of Irish immigration there in the next few decades .
Along with French Canadians who crossed over from Quebec , these two groups provided the bulk of workers involved in the Rideau Canal project and the booming timber trade , both instrumental in putting Ottawa on the map .
The region 's population grew significantly when the canal was completed by Colonel John By in 1832 .
It was intended to provide a secure route between Montreal and Kingston on Lake Ontario , by-passing the stretch of the St. Lawrence River bordering New York State -LRB- the U.S invasions of Canada in the War of 1812 being a recent memory -RRB- .
Construction of the canal began at the northern end , where Colonel By set up a military barracks on what later became Parliament Hill , and laid out a townsite that soon became known as Bytown .
Original city leaders of Bytown include a number of Wright 's sons , most notably Ruggles Wright .
Nicholas Sparks , Braddish Billings and Abraham Dow were the first to settle on the Ontario side of the Ottawa river .
The west side of the canal became known as `` Uppertown '' where the Parliament buildings are located , while the east side of the canal -LRB- wedged between the canal and Rideau River -RRB- was known as the `` Lowertown '' .
At that time , Lowertown was a crowded , boisterous shanty town , frequently receiving the worst of disease epidemics , such as the Cholera outbreak in 1832 , and typhus in 1847 .
Ottawa became a centre for lumber milling and square-cut timber industry in Canada and , in fact , for North America as a whole .
From there , it quickly expanded further up -LRB- or westward along -RRB- the Ottawa River , and logs were boomed by raftsmen great distances down the river to the mills .
Bytown was renamed Ottawa in 1855 , when it was incorporated as a city .
Ottawa as the capital
On December 31 , 1857 , Queen Victoria was asked to choose a common capital for the Province of Canada -LRB- modern Quebec and Ontario -RRB- and chose Ottawa .
There are old folk tales about how she made the choice : that she did so by sticking her hatpin on a map roughly halfway between Toronto and Montreal , or that she liked watercolours she had seen of the area .
While such stories have no historical basis , they do illustrate how arbitrary the choice of Ottawa seemed to Canadians at the time .
While Ottawa is now a major metropolis and Canada 's fourth largest city , at the time it was a sometimes unruly logging town in the hinterland , far away from the colony 's main cities , Quebec City and Montreal in Canada East , and Kingston and Toronto in Canada West .
The Centre Block , on Parliament Hill .
In fact , the Queen 's advisers suggested she pick Ottawa for many important reasons : first , it was the only settlement of any significant size located right on the border of Canada East and Canada West -LRB- the post 1841 name for the then united regions formerly known as Upper and Lower Canada , today the Quebec/Ontario border -RRB- , making it a compromise between the two colonies and their French and English populations ; second , the War of 1812 had shown how vulnerable major Canadian cities were to American attack , since they were all located very close to the border while Ottawa was -LRB- then -RRB- surrounded by a dense forest far from the border ; third , the government owned a large parcel of land on a spectacular spot overlooking the Ottawa River .
Ottawa 's position in the back country made it more defensible , while still allowing easy transportation via the Ottawa River to Canada East , and the Rideau Canal to Canada West .
Two other considerations were that Ottawa was at a point nearly exactly midway between Toronto and Quebec City -LRB- ~500 km/310 mi -RRB- and that the small size of the town made it less likely that politically motivated mobs could go on a rampage and destroy government buildings , as had been the case in the previous Canadian capitals .
The Ottawa River and the Rideau Canal network meant that Ottawa could be supplied by water from Kingston and Montreal without going along the potentially treacherous US-Canada border .
Annexation history of Ottawa
The original Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa was destroyed by fire on February 3 , 1916 .
The House of Commons and Senate were temporarily relocated to the recently constructed Victoria Memorial Museum , currently the Canadian Museum of Nature , located about south of Parliament Hill on McLeod Street at Metcalfe Street .
A new Centre Block was completed in 1922 , the centrepiece of which is a dominant Gothic revival styled structure known as the Peace Tower which has become a common emblem of the city .
On September 5 , 1945 , only weeks after the end of World War II , Ottawa was the site of the event that many people consider to be the official start of the Cold War .
A Soviet cipher clerk , Igor Gouzenko , defected from the Soviet embassy with over 100 secret documents .
At first , the Royal Canadian Mounted Police -LRB- RCMP -RRB- refused to take the documents , as the Soviets were still allies of Canada and Britain , and the newspapers were not interested in the story .
After hiding out for a night in a neighbour 's apartment , listening to his own home being searched , Gouzenko finally persuaded the RCMP to look at his evidence , which provided proof of a massive Soviet spy network operating in western countries , and , indirectly , led to the discovery that the Soviets were working on an atomic bomb to match that of the Americans .
In 2001 , the old city of Ottawa -LRB- estimated 2005 population 350,000 -RRB- was amalgamated with the suburbs of Nepean -LRB- 135,000 -RRB- , Kanata -LRB- 85,000 -RRB- , Gloucester -LRB- 120,000 -RRB- , Rockcliffe Park -LRB- 2,100 -RRB- , Vanier -LRB- 17,000 -RRB- and Cumberland -LRB- 55,000 -RRB- , and the rural townships of West Carleton -LRB- 18,000 -RRB- , Osgoode -LRB- 13,000 -RRB- , Rideau -LRB- 18,000 -RRB- and Goulbourn -LRB- 24,000 -RRB- , along with the systems and infrastructure of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton , OrlÃ©ans , Ontario -LRB- 84,695 -RRB- , to become one municipality .
Ottawa-Carleton used to be just Carleton County before 1969 and consisted of what is now the City of Ottawa except for Cumberland .
Geography and climate
Map of Ottawa showing urban area , highways , waterways , and historic townships
Ottawa is situated on the south bank of the Ottawa River , and contains the mouths of the Rideau River and Rideau Canal .
The oldest part of the city -LRB- including what remains of Bytown -RRB- is known as Lower Town , and occupies an area between the canal and the rivers .
Across the canal to the west lies Centretown -LRB- often just called `` downtown '' -RRB- , which is the city 's financial and commercial hub .
Situated between Centretown and the Ottawa River , the slight elevation of Parliament Hill is home to many of the capital 's landmark government buildings , including the Peace Tower , and the Legislative seat of Canada .
As of June 29 , 2007 , the Rideau Canal , which stretches to Kingston , Fort Henry and four Martello towers in the Kingston area was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site .

The Rideau Canal serves as a waterway in summer and a skating rink in winter .
The City of Ottawa has a main urban area but there are many other urban , suburban and rural areas within the city 's limits .
The main suburban area extends a considerable distance to the east , west and south of the centre , and includes the former cities of Gloucester , Nepean and Vanier , the former village of Rockcliffe Park and also the community of Blackburn Hamlet -LRB- pop. 8,527 -RRB- , the community of OrlÃ©ans -LRB- pop. 110,000 -RRB- .
The Kanata suburban area consists of Kanata -LRB- pop. 90,000 -RRB- and the former village of Stittsville -LRB- pop. 20,000 -RRB- .
Nepean is another major suburb which also includes Barrhaven -LRB- pop. 70,000 -RRB- and the former village of Manotick -LRB- pop. 7,545 -RRB- .
There are also the communities of Riverside South -LRB- pop. 8,000 -RRB- on the other side of the Rideau River , Morgan 's Grant -LRB- pop. 8,000 -RRB- and Greely -LRB- pop. 4,152 -RRB- , southeast of Riverside South .
There are also a number of rural communities -LRB- villages and hamlets -RRB- that lie beyond the greenbelt but are administratively part of the Ottawa municipality .
Some of these communities are Burritts Rapids -LRB- hamlet , pop. 300 -RRB- ; Ashton -LRB- hamlet , pop. 300 -RRB- ; Fallowfield -LRB- hamlet , pop. 600 -RRB- ; Kars -LRB- small village , pop. 1,539 -RRB- ; Fitzroy Harbour -LRB- small village , pop. 1,549 -RRB- ; Munster -LRB- large village , pop. 1,390 -RRB- ; Carp -LRB- large village , pop. 1,400 -RRB- ; North Gower -LRB- large village , pop. 1,700 -RRB- ; Metcalfe -LRB- large village , pop. 1,810 -RRB- ; Constance Bay -LRB- large village , pop. 2,327 -RRB- and Osgoode -LRB- large village , pop. 2,571 -RRB- and Richmond -LRB- very large village , pop. 3,301 -RRB- .
There are also a number of towns in the national capital region but outside the city of Ottawa , one of these urban communities is Almonte , Ontario -LRB- town , pop. 4,649 -RRB- .
Across the Ottawa River , which forms the border between Ontario and Quebec , lies the city of Gatineau .
Although formally and administratively separate cities in two separate provinces , Ottawa and Gatineau -LRB- along with a number of nearby municipalities -RRB- collectively constitute the National Capital Region , with a combined population exceeding one million residents , which is considered a single metropolitan area .
One federal crown corporation -LRB- the National Capital Commission , or NCC -RRB- has significant land holdings in both cities , including sites of historical and touristic importance .
The NCC , through its responsibility for planning and development of these lands , is an important contributor to both cities .
Around the main urban area is an extensive greenbelt , administered by the National Capital Commission for conservation and leisure , and comprising mostly forest , farmland and marshland .
Ottawa itself is a single-tiered city , meaning it is in itself a census division and has no county or regional municipality government above it .
Ottawa is bounded on the east by the United Counties of Prescott and Russell ; by Renfrew County and Lanark County in the west ; on the south by the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville and the United Counties of Stormont , Dundas and Glengarry ; and on the north by the Regional County Municipality of Les Collines-de-l'Outaouais and the City of Gatineau .
Ottawa is made up of eleven historic townships , ten of which are from historic Carleton County and one from historic Russell .
They are Cumberland , Fitzroy , Gloucester , Goulbourn , Huntley , March , Marlborough , Nepean , North Gower , Osgoode and Torbolton .
Climate
Ottawa has a humid continental climate -LRB- Koppen Dfb -RRB- with a range of temperatures from a record high of 37.8 Â°C -LRB- 100Â°F -RRB- , recorded July 4 , 1913 , to a record low of -38.9 Â°C -LRB- -38 Â°F -RRB- recorded on December 29 , 1933 URL_http , the fourth coldest temperature recorded in a capital city -LRB- after Ulaanbaatar , Mongolia ; Astana , Kazakhstan and Moscow , Russia -RRB- .
This extreme range in temperature allows Ottawa to boast a variety of annual activitiesâmore notable events such as the Winterlude Festival on the Rideau Canal in the winter and the National Canada Day celebrations on Parliament Hill in Julyâand the requirement of a wide range of clothing .
Because of its relatively warm summers , Ottawa is only the seventh coldest capital in the world by annual average temperature , however by mean January temperature , Ottawa ranks third behind Ulaanbaatar , Mongolia and Astana , Kazakhstan and has a colder average January temperature than Moscow , much further north than Ottawa .
Snow and ice are dominant during the winter season .
Ottawa receives about 235 centimetres -LRB- 93 in -RRB- of snowfall annually .
Its biggest snowfall was recorded on March 3-4 , 1947 with 73 cm -LRB- 2.5 feet -RRB- of snow .
Average January temperature is -10.8 Â°C -LRB- 13 Â°F -RRB- , although days well above freezing and nights below -30 Â°C -LRB- -22 Â°F -RRB- both occur in the winter .
The snow season is quite variable ; in an average winter , a lasting snow cover is on the ground from mid-December until early April , although some years are snow-free until beyond Christmas , particularly in recent years .
The 2007â08 winter season snowfall -LRB- 432.7 cm / 170.3 inches -RRB- came within 10 cm -LRB- 4 inches -RRB- of the record snowfall set in 1970-1971 -LRB- 444.1 cm / 174.8 inches -RRB- .
High wind chills are common , with annual averages of 51 , 14 and 1 days with wind chills below -20 Â°C -LRB- -4 Â°F -RRB- , -30 Â°C -LRB- -22 Â°F -RRB- and -40 Â°C -LRB- -40 Â°F -RRB- respectively .
The lowest recorded wind chill was of -47.8 Â°C -LRB- -54.0 Â°F -RRB- on January 8 , 1968 .
Freezing rain is also relatively common , even relative to other parts of the country .
One such large storm caused power outages and affected the local economy , and came to be known as the 1998 Ice Storm .
Summers are fairly warm and humid in Ottawa , although they are moderate in length .
The average July maximum temperature is 26 Â°C -LRB- 80 Â°F -RRB- , with occasional northerly incursions of comfortable , cool air which drop humidity levels , although daytime temperatures of 30 Â°C -LRB- 86 Â°F -RRB- or higher are commonplace in most summers .
A maximum temperature of 39.5 Â°C -LRB- 103 Â°F -RRB- was recorded in the summer of 2005 at certain locations .
During periods of hot weather , high humidity is often an aggravating factor , especially close to the rivers .
Ottawa annually averages 41 , 12 and 2 days with humidex -LRB- combined temperature & humidity index -RRB- above 30 Â°C -LRB- 86 Â°F -RRB- , 35 Â°C -LRB- 95 Â°F -RRB- and 40 Â°C -LRB- 104 Â°F -RRB- respectively .
The highest recorded humidex was 48 Â°C -LRB- 118 Â°F -RRB- on August 1 , 2006 .
The Ottawa River in summer .
Spring and fall are variable , prone to extremes in temperature and unpredictable swings in conditions .
Hot days above 30 Â°C -LRB- 86 Â°F -RRB- have occurred as early as March -LRB- as in 2002 -RRB- or as late as October , as well as snow well into May and early in October -LRB- although such events are extremely unusual and brief -RRB- .
Average annual precipitation averages around 943 millimetres -LRB- 37 in. -RRB- .
The biggest one-day rainfall occurred on September 9 , 2004 when the remnants of Hurricane Frances dumped nearly 136 mm -LRB- 51â2 inches -RRB- of rain in the city .
There are about 2,060 hours of average sunshine annually -LRB- 47 % of possible -RRB- .
Destructive summer weather events such as tornadoes , major flash floods , extreme heat waves , severe hail and remnant effects from hurricanes are rare , but all have occurred in the Ottawa area .
Some of the most notable tornadoes in the region occurred in 1978 -LRB- F2 -RRB- , 1994 -LRB- F3 -RRB- , 1999 -LRB- F1 -RRB- and 2002 -LRB- F1 -RRB- .

Inter-city services
Ottawa is served by inter-city passenger rail service by VIA Rail , a number of airlines that fly into the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport , and inter-city bus companies such as Greyhound operating out of the Ottawa Central Bus Station .
Highways , streets and roads
The capital city of Canada is also served by a network of freeways , the main one being provincial Highway 417 -LRB- called The Queensway -RRB- , Ottawa-Carleton Regional Road 174 -LRB- formerly Provincial Highway 17 -RRB- , and Highway 416 -LRB- Veterans ' Memorial Highway -RRB- , connecting Ottawa to the rest of the 400-Series Highway network in Ontario .
Highway 417 is also the Ottawa portion of the Trans-Canada Highway .
The city also has several scenic parkways -LRB- promenades -RRB- , such as the Ottawa River Parkway , Aviation Parkway and has a freeway connection to Autoroute 5 and Autoroute 50 , in Hull .
For a complete listing of the parkways and roads in Ottawa , see the List of Ottawa roads .
Public transit
The O-Train , Ottawa 's light rail train system
The public transit system is operated by OC Transpo , a department of the city .
An integrated system of services is available consisting of : -LRB- 1 -RRB- regular buses travelling on fixed routes in mixed traffic , typical of most urban transit systems ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- a bus rapid transit -LRB- BRT -RRB- system - a high frequency bus service operating on the transitway - a network comprised of mostly grade-separated dedicated bus lanes within their own right-of-way and having full stations with Park & Ride facilities further supported by on-road reserved bus lanes and priority traffic signal controls ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- a light rail transit -LRB- LRT -RRB- system known as the O-Train operating on one north-south route ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- a door-to-door bus service for the disabled known as ParaTranspo .
Both OC Transpo and the Quebec-based SociÃ©tÃ© de transport de l'Outaouais -LRB- STO -RRB- operate bus services between Ottawa and Gatineau .
A transfer or bus pass of one is accepted on the other without having to pay a top-up fare on regular routes .
Navigable waterways
Ottawa sits at the confluence of three major rivers : the Ottawa River , the Gatineau River and the Rideau River .
The Ottawa and Gatineau rivers were historically important in the logging and lumber industries , and the Rideau as part of the Rideau Canal system connecting the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River with the Ottawa River .
The Rideau Canal , which starts in Kingston , Ontario , winds its way through the city .
The final flight of locks on the canal are between Parliament Hill and the ChÃ¢teau Laurier .
Also , during the winter season the canal is usually open and is a form of transportation downtown for about 7.8 kilometres -LRB- 4.8 mi -RRB- for ice skaters -LRB- from a point near Carleton University to the Rideau Centre -RRB- and forms the world 's largest skating rink .
Bicycle and pedestrian pathways
There is a large network of paved multi-use pathways that wind their way through much of the city , including along the Ottawa River , Rideau River , and Rideau Canal .
These pathways are used for transportation , tourism , and recreation .
Because most streets either have wide curb lanes or bicycle lanes , cycling is a popular mode of transportation in the region throughout the year .

Landmarks and notable institutions
The ChÃ¢teau Laurier in downtown Ottawa .
Ottawa is home to a wealth of national museums , official residences , government buildings , memorials and heritage structures .
Federal buildings in the National Capital Region are managed by the Public Works Canada , while most of the federal lands in the Region are managed by the National Capital Commission or NCC ; its control of much undeveloped land gives the NCC a great deal of influence over the city 's development .
In 2006 , the National Capital Commission completed work on the long-discussed Confederation Boulevard , a ceremonial route linking key attractions in National Capital Region , on both sides of the Ottawa River , in Ottawa as well as Gatineau , Quebec .
The Ottawa skyline has remained conservative in skyscraper height throughout the years due to a skyscraper height restriction .
First installed to keep Parliament Hill visible from most parts of the City , that initial restriction was changed to a more realistic law many years later .
The restriction allows no building to overwhelm the skyline , keeping almost all the downtown building around the same 25-30 story range .
Other cities with building height restrictions like Ottawa 's include Washington DC , Belfast , Northern Ireland , St. Petersburg , Russia , amongst others .

In addition to being the capital of Canada , Ottawa is politically diverse with regard to local politics .
Most of the city traditionally supports the Liberal Party , although only some parts of the city are consistent Liberal strongholds .
Perhaps the safest areas for the Liberals are the ones dominated by francophones , especially in Vanier and central Gloucester .
Central Ottawa is usually more left -leaning , and the New Democratic Party can win ridings there as government unions and activist groups are fairly strong .
Some of Ottawa 's suburbs are swing areas , notably central Nepean and , despite its Francophone population , OrlÃ©ans .
The southern and western parts of the old city of Ottawa are generally moderate or slightly left of centre but periodically swing to the Conservative Party .
The farther one goes from the city centre into suburban fringes like Kanata and Barrhaven and rural areas , the voters tend to be increasingly conservative , both fiscally and socially .
This is especially true in the former Townships of West Carleton , Goulbourn , Rideau and Osgoode , which are more in line with the staunchly conservative areas in the surrounding counties .
However not all rural areas support the Conservative Party .
Rural parts of the former township of Cumberland , with a large number of Francophones , traditionally support the Liberal Party , though their support has recently weakened .
Ottawa became the legislative capital of the Northwest Territories when it reverted to 1870 constitutional status , after Alberta , and Saskatchewan were carved out in 1905 .
From 1905 to 1951 almost all of the council members were civil servants living in Ottawa .
From 1951 to 1967 the territory alternated legislative sessions with various Northwest Territories communities .
Ottawa only held legislative sessions of the council .
Fort Smith , Northwest Territories became the administrative centre and officially housed the civil service from 1911 to 1967 .

Pherecydes of Syros
See also Pherecydes of Leros
Pherecydes of Syros -LRB- in Greek : Φερεκύδης -RRB- was a Greek thinker from the island of Syros , of the 6th century BC .
Pherecydes authored the Pentemychos or Heptamychos , one of the first attested prose works in Greek literature , which formed an important bridge between mythic and pre-Socratic thought .
Life
Very little is known of his life .
The sources are often contradictory .
It has been said that he was a son of Babys , and that he was most likely active in ca. 540 BC .
Pentemychos or Heptamychos
Note that Pherecydes ' book is called `` Heptamychos '' -LRB- `` seven recesses '' -RRB- in the Suda and in all modern sources .
In this work , Pherecydes taught his philosophy through the medium of mythic representations .
Although it is lost , the fragments that survive are enough to reconstruct a basic outline .
Aristotle in Metaphysics -LRB- section 1091 b 8 -RRB- thus characterized Pherecydes ' work as a mixture of myth and philosophy .
The book `` Pentemychos '' is an elaborate version of cosmogenesis , describing how three eternal `` things '' or `` beings '' beget -LRB- or become , depending on how you read -RRB- a number of principles or forms before the ordered world , the cosmos , appears .
The three eternal principles are Zas -LRB- `` he who lives '' -RRB- , Chronos -LRB- `` time '' -RRB- , and Chthonie -LRB- `` underlying the earth '' -RRB- .
The piecing together of what can be unraveled from the fragments tells us that Chronos -LRB- pre-cosmic not yet ordered time , one of Pherecydes ' three eternals , to be distinguished from Kronos ; ordered time -RRB- has an offspring , born when Chronos ' seed is put into the pentemychos -LRB- `` five recesses '' -RRB- .
It is described in a fragment preserved in Damascius ' `` De Principiis '' that from the seed disposed into the pentemychos `` were composed numerous other offspring of gods , what is called of the five recesses '' .
A close relationship is thought to exist between these recesses and Chthonie , which is another of the three first-existing things .
Chthonie has to do with the origin of the word `` chthonic '' ; her name means `` underlying the earth '' .
Hesiod described Tartaros as being `` in a mychos of broad-wayed earth '' , through which we may guess at a close affinity between krater , mychos , and Chthonie .
Professor Hermann S. Schibli , author of the most acclaimed academic book on Pherecydes , thinks the five mychos were actually harboured within Chthonie , or at least were so initially when Chronos disposed his seed in the five `` nooks '' .
Alongside Chthonie and Chronos , Pherecydes held a power called Zas .
Zas is thought to be a strange etymological form of Zeus , and to be identical with he Orphic Eros in function , and as such a personification of masculine , or simply sexual , creativity .
Proclus said that `` Pherecydes used to say that Zeus changed into Eros when about to create , for the reason that , having created the world from opposites , he led it into agreement and peace and sowed sameness in all things , and unity that interpenetrates the universe '' .
The act of creation itself -LRB- perhaps it is more accurate to say that Chronos creates -- it is from his seed that the actual `` stuff '' comes from -- and that Zas orders and distributes -RRB- is described mytho-poetically as Zas making a cloth on which he decorates earth and sea , and which he then presents as a wedding gift to Chthonie , and wraps around her .
Yet , in another fragment it is not Chthonie , but `` a winged oak '' that he wraps the cloth around .
The stories are not mutually exclusive , simply different .
The chronology is hard to figure out because much is lacking in the fragments , but one thing is clear , and that is that creation is hindered by chaotic forces .
Before the world is ordered a cosmic battle takes place , with Kronos -LRB- ordered time -RRB- as the head of one side and Ophioneus as the leader of the other .
The same story is elsewhere enacted with Zeus and Typhon/Typhoeus as leading characters , and it also has close parallels in many myths from cultures other than the Greek -LRB- Marduk vs. Tiamat , etc -RRB- .
Ophioneus and its brood are often depicted as ruling the birthing cosmos for some time , before falling from power .
The chaotic forces are eternal and can not be destroyed ; instead they are thrown out from the ordered world and locked away in Tartaros in a kind of `` appointment of the spheres '' , in which the victor -LRB- Zeus-Kronos -RRB- takes possession of the sky and of space and time .
The locks to Tartaros are fashioned in iron by Zeus , and might hence have been associated with his element of aither , and in bronze by Poseidon , which might indicate a link to water -LRB- which was often conceived of as the `` first matter '' -RRB- .
Judging from some ancient fragments Ophioneus is thrown into Okeanos , not into Tartaros .
Exactly what entities or forces that were locked away in Pherecydesâ story can not be known for sure , unless his book was miraculously recovered .
Good guesswork would be to have five principal figures .
We know that Ophioneus , or Typhon , was one and the same .
We also know that Eurynome fought on the side of Ophioneus against Kronos .
That Chthonie is a principal `` thing '' of the underworld is almost superfluous to argue , but whether she is to be counted as one of the five or the five `` sum-total '' is more of an open question .
Apart from these we know that Ophioneus-Typhon mated with Echidna , and that Echidna herself was somehow mysteriously `` produced '' by Callirhoe .
If Pherecydes counted five principal entities in association the pentemychos doctrine , then Ophioneus , Eurynome , Echidna , Calirrhoe and Chthonie are the main contenders .
As said , Kronos is replaced by Zeus in the more popularly known version , but the overall story remains the same .
Kronos/Zeus orders the offspring out from the cosmos to Tartaros .
There they are kept behind locked gates , fashioned in iron -LRB- associated with Zeus and his element of sky/space -RRB- and bronze -LRB- by Poseidon -- the water force -RRB- .
We are told about chaotic beings put into the pentemychos , and we are told that the Darkness has an offspring that is cast into the recesses of Tartaros .
A fragment exclusively making the equation for us is lacking , but it does indeed seem very , very plausible that the prison-house in Tartaros and the pentemychos are ways of referring to the essentially same thing .
According to Celcus , Pherecydes said that : `` Below that portion is the portion of Tartaros ; the daughters of Boreas -LSB- the north wind -RSB- , the Harpies and Thuella -LSB- Storm -RSB- , guard it ; there Zeus banished any of the gods whenever one behaves with insolence . ''
Considering this statement , Pherecydes ' own words , the identity between Zeus ' prison-house and the pentemychos seems exceedingly likely .
Pherecydes ' `` Pentemychos '' is thought to have contained a mystical esoteric teaching , treated allegorically .
One ancient commentator said that :
`` Also , Pherecydes , the man of Syros , talks of recesses and pits and caves and doors and gates , and through these speaks in riddles of becomings and deceases of souls . ''
A comparatively large number of sources say Pherecydes was the first to teach the eternality and transmigration of human souls .
That he was the first to teach such a thing is doubtful , but that he was among the first and that he did profess this teaching is certain .
Professor Hermann S. Schibli , the most acclaimed scholar on Pherecydes , concludes that Pherecydes `` included in his book -LSB- `` Pentemychos '' -RSB- at least a rudimentary treatment of the immortality of the soul , its wanderings in the underworld , and the reasons for the soulâs incarnations '' .
Astronomy
Aside from his writing , Pherecydes is known for having made a sundial on the island of Syros .
The Science Center & Technology Museum of Thessaloniki website informs us : His works include :
- A ` heliotropion ' , or ` shadow-chaser ' : The first example of this instrument , which was a more advanced kind of gnomon used to determine midday and to calculate the length of the year and the geographical latitude , was built by Pherecydes in Samos .
Pherecydes predicted lunar and solar eclipses .
Influence
Pherecydes ' contribution to the early Presocratic thought is -LRB- 1 -RRB- the denial of ex nihilo creation ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- cosmos self-creation ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the eternal nature of the first principles .
Both Cicero and Augustine thought that Pherecydes of Syros first taught the immortality of the soul .
Diogenes Laertius writes that some considered Pherecydes to have been the teacher of Pythagoras .
He is occasionally counted among the Seven Sages of Greece .

Musa bin Nusair
Musa bin Nusair also Musa ben Nusair or Musa Ibn Nusayr -LRB- ; 640â716 -RRB- was a Syrian Muslim who served as a governor and general under the Ummayad caliph Al-Walid I .
He had ruled over the Muslim provinces of North Africa -LRB- Ifriqiya -RRB- , and directed the conquest of the Visigothic kingdom in Hispania .
Background
Musa 's father was an Arab of either Syria or Western Iraq -LRB- there are several different opinions -RRB- who was captured during the first Muslim expeditions and made a slave .
After being given his freedom he returned to Syria to a town called Kafarma , where Musa was born .
Apparently , Musa was lame .
Musa according to the most reliable reports state that he was the son of a Jewish convert to Islam .
This convert had preferred relation with Muawiya -LRB- first Muslim Governor of Syria and first Umayyad Dynasty Caliph -RRB- .
He advised Muawiyah that the only way to capture Constantinople is from both sides , His son Musa was groomed to be the leader of the army to start the western invasion starting from Spain .
However this plan was delayed because the outbreak of civil war among Muslims .
Conquest of Maghrib
Uqba bin Nafi was sent to continue the Islamic conquests in North Africa all the way to Morocco .
However , his policies were quite strict and he did not tolerate Berber traditions .
This caused fierce resistance from the Berbers , leading to his demise in a battle against an alliance of Byzantines and Berbers .
Musa bin Nusair was then sent to renew the attacks against the Berbers .
But he did not impose Islam by force , rather , he respected Berber traditions and used diplomacy in subjugating them .
This proved highly successful , as many Berbers converted to Islam and even entered his army as soldiers and officers , amongst whom would be Tariq bin Ziyad who would lead the later Islamic expedition in Iberia .
Musa as Governor
Few years earlier in 698 he had been made the governor of Ifriqiya and was responsible for completing the Umayyad conquest of North Africa and reconquest of Cyprus , the Balearic Islands and Sardinia .
He was the first governor of Ifriqiya not to be subordinate to the governor of Egypt .
He was the first Muslim general to take Tangiers and occupy it ; his troops also conquered the Sous , effectively taking control of all of modern Morocco .
He also had to deal with constant harassment from the Byzantine navy and he built a navy that would go on to conquer the islands of Ibiza , Majorca , and Minorca .
Conquest of Al-Andalus
Background
Musllim and Spanish sources quote that while Musa bin Nusair was eager to cross the strait across the sea to land mass of the Iberian peninsula , he was only encouraged to do so when a Visigoth nobleman , Julian , had come to Musa encouraging him to invade Iberia , telling him of the people 's sufferings and the injustice of their king , Roderick , while giving him cause for conquest by telling him of the riches that would be found , and the many palaces , gardens and beauties of Iberia .
Sources claim that his real cause for encouraging such an invasion was that his daughter , Florinda , had been abused by King Roderick , disgracing Julian 's personal honor .
Invasion
After a successful minor raid on the coast of today 's Portugal , and the raiding force returning with a booty they captured without any reported resistance , Musa decided to land a larger invasion force .
Tariq bin Ziyad crossed the strait with approximately 7,000 Berbers and Arabs , and landed at Gibraltar -LRB- from Jebel Tariq , meaning Tariq 's mountain in Arabic -RRB- .
The expedition 's purpose must have been to conduct further raids and explore the territory .
Tariq 's army contained some guides supplied by Julian .
Three weeks after his landing , the Muslims were faced with a superior Visigoth army of nearly 20,000 lead by King Roderick .
The Muslims won the Battle of Guadalete and the entire Visigoth nobility was all but exterminated at the battle .
The Muslims then marched towards Cordoba , bypassing several strong fortifications .
The ill defended city fell and Tariq established a garrison their comprising mainly of the city 's Jews who welcomed the invaders , having been subjected to extermination from the Visigoths for centuries .
Tariq then continued on his way to Toledo .
Musa , learning of Tariq 's successes , landed in Iberia with an army 18,000 Berbers and Arabs .
He planned to rendevouz with Tariq at Toledo , but first proceeded to take Seville , which Tariq had bypassed , and where Musa met stiff resistance , and succeeded after three months of siege .
He then campaigned in the area that is today 's Portugal , eliminating the remaining Gothic resistance there .
His last destination before meeting Tariq was to subdue Merida .
After five months of siege and inconclusive fighting , a group of Ceutans pretended to be Christian reinforcements and managed to convince the guards into opening the gates .
Once inside , the `` reinforcements '' , nearly 700 , overwhelmed the guards and managed to keep the gates open for the Muslims to enter the city and capture it .
After Merida , Musa divided his forces , taking the majority with him to meet Tariq at Toledo where he would remain for winter .
The remainder of his forces where led by his son ` Abd al-Aziz , who would return to Sevilla to deal with an uprising .
` Abd al-Aziz made short work of the rebellion .
He then conducted several campaigns on the return journey in the territories comprising future Portugal .
Coimbra and Santarem were captured in the spring of 714 .
` Abd al-Aziz then campaigned in Murcia .
The Duke of Murcia , Theodemir , or Tudmir as he was called by the Muslims , surrendered to ` Abd al-Aziz after several hard-fought engagements in April 713 .
The terms imposed on Theodemir declared that the duke would keep the citadel of Orihuela and several other settlements , including Alicante and Lorca on the Mediterranean , that his followers will not be killed , taken prisoner , forced into Islam , and that their churches will not be burned .
It also demanded that Theodemir not encourage or support others to resist the Muslims , and that he pay an annual tax in money and other goods .
Musa finally met up with Tariq where there was an argument over the latter 's booty , which reportedly included a table holding gems and other precious stones that belonged to King Solomon .
Meanwhile , Musa 's messenger , Mughith al-Rumi -LRB- the Roman -RRB- who had been sent to Caliph al-Walid to inform him of the situation in Iberia , had returned .
The Caliph requested Musa to withdraw and to report in person to Damascus .
Musa chose to ignore this order temporarily , knowing that if he did not continue his advance , Visigoth resistance may increase and turn the tables against the Muslims .
Having done so , he continued with Tariq to the north ; Musa heading for Zaragoza , to which he lay siege , while Tariq continued to the provinces of Leon and Castile , capturing the towns of Leon and Astorga .
Musa continued after taking Zaragoza to the north , taking Oviedo and reaching as far as the Bay of Biscay .
The conquest of Iberia now complete , Musa proceeded to place governors and prefects throughout the newly conquered Al-Andalus , before returning to Damascus with most of the booty captured from the Jihad .
Return to Damascus
Both North African leaders were therefore summoned by the caliph to Damascus .
Tariq arrived first .
But then the caliph was taken ill .
So the caliph 's brother , Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik became temporarily in charge , and asked Musa , who was arriving with a cavalcade of soldiers and spoils , to delay his grand entry into the city .
He most certainly intended to claim the glories brought from the conquest for himself .
But Musa dismissed this request , triumphantly entered Damascus anyway , and brought the booty before the ailing Al-Walid I , which brought Musa and Tariq unprecedented popularity amongst the people of Damascus .
Al-Walid I then died a few days later and was succeeded by his brother Sulayman , who demanded that Musa deliver up all his spoils .
When Musa complained , Suleiman stripped him of his rank and confiscated all the booty , including a table which had reputedly once belonged to Solomon .
He ordered that Musa -LRB- a very old man by then -RRB- to be paraded in the city 's streets with a rope around his neck and Musa said `` Oh , Caliph , I deserve a better rewarding than this '' .
Reports claim he was seen begging at a mosque door in the last days of his life .
One of Musa 's sons , Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa , became married a Spanish woman , who was the daughter of Roderick .
She asked ` Abd al-Aziz why his guests did not bow to him as they used tot do in the presence of her father .
It was reported that he began to force guests to bow to him .
It was rumoured that he had secretly become a Christian , and a group of Arabs assassinated him , cut off his head and sent it to the caliph .
Sulayman had Musa in his audience when the head arrived , and seeing whose it was , callously asked Musa if he recognized it .
Musa maintained his dignity , saying he recognized it as belonging to someone who had always practiced the faith fervently , and cursed the men who had killed him .
Musa died naturally while on the Hajj pilgrimage with Sulayman in about the year 715-716 .
Because of his disgrace , and the misfortunes of his sons , there was a tendency among medieval historians of the Maghreb to attribute his deeds -LRB- the conquest of Tangiers and the Sous -RRB- to Uqba ibn Nafi .

Calcium carbonate
Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the chemical formula Ca C O3 .
It is a common substance found in rock in all parts of the world , and is the main component of shells of marine organisms , snails , pearls , and eggshells .
Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime , and is usually the principal cause of hard water .
It is commonly used medicinally as a calcium supplement or as an antacid , but high consumption can be hazardous .
Occurrence
Calcium carbonate is found naturally as the following minerals and rocks :
Aragonite
Calcite
Vaterite or -LRB- Î¼-CaCO3 -RRB-
Chalk -LRB- Blackboard chalk is calcium sulfate , CaSO4 -RRB-
Limestone
Marble
Travertine
To test whether a mineral or rock contains carbonate , strong acids such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid can be added to it ; if the sample does contain carbonate , it will fizz and produce carbon dioxide and water .
-LRB- Although sulfuric acid reacts , the reaction soon ceases because the calcium sulfate produced is rather insoluble in water and limits the reaction . -RRB-
Weak acids such as acetic acid will react , albeit less vigorously .
All of the rocks/minerals mentioned above will react with acid .
To test for calcium , prepare a platinum or nichrome wire and dip it into some hydrochloric acid .
Then dip the wire into some crushed sample to be tested .
Place the wire in a bunsen burner flame ; if calcium is presented in the sample a brick-red flame will be produced .
If a sample gives positive results for both of the two tests above , the presence of calcium carbonate is indicated .
Chemical properties
See also : Carbonate
Calcium carbonate shares the typical properties of other carbonates .
Notably :
it reacts with strong acids , releasing carbon dioxide :
CaCO3 -LRB- s -RRB- + 2HCl -LRB- aq -RRB- â CaCl2 -LRB- aq -RRB- + CO2 -LRB- g -RRB- + H2O -LRB- l -RRB-
it releases carbon dioxide on heating -LRB- to above 840 Â°C in the case of CaCO3 -RRB- , to form calcium oxide , commonly called quicklime , with reaction enthalpy 178 kJ / mole :
CaCO3 → CaO + CO2
Calcium carbonate will react with water that is saturated with carbon dioxide to form the soluble calcium bicarbonate .
CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O â Ca -LRB- HCO3 -RRB- 2
This reaction is important in the erosion of carbonate rocks , forming caverns , and leads to hard water in many regions .
Preparation
Mississippian marble in Big Cottonwood Canyon , Wasatch Mountains , Utah .
The vast majority of calcium carbonate used in industry is extracted by mining or quarrying .
Pure calcium carbonate -LRB- e.g. for food or pharmaceutical use -RRB- , can be produced from a pure quarried source -LRB- usually marble -RRB- .
Alternatively , calcium oxide is prepared by calcining crude calcium carbonate .
Water is added to give calcium hydroxide , and carbon dioxide is passed through this solution to precipitate the desired calcium carbonate , referred to in the industry as precipitated calcium carbonate -LRB- PCC -RRB- :
CaCO3 → CaO + CO2
CaO + H2O â Ca -LRB- OH -RRB- 2
Ca -LRB- OH -RRB- 2 + CO2 â CaCO3 + H2O
Uses
Industrial applications
The main use of calcium carbonate is in the construction industry , either as a building material in its own right -LRB- e.g. marble -RRB- or limestone aggregate for roadbuilding or as an ingredient of cement or as the starting material for the preparation of builder 's lime by burning in a kiln .
Calcium carbonate is also used in the purification of iron from iron ore in a blast furnace .
Calcium carbonate is calcined in situ to give calcium oxide , which forms a slag with various impurities present , and separates from the purified iron .
Calcium carbonate is also used in the oil industry in drilling fluids as a formation bridging and filtercake sealing agent and may also be used as a weighting material to increase the density of drilling fluids to control downhole pressures .
Calcium carbonate is also one of the main sources used in growing Seacrete , or Biorock .
Precipitated Calcium carbonate , pre-dispersed in slurry form , is also now widely used as filler material for latex gloves with the aim of achieving maximum saving in material and production costs .
Calcium carbonate is widely used as an extender in paints , in particular matte emulsion paint where typically 30 % by weight of the paint is either chalk or marble .
Calcium carbonate is also widely used as a filler in plastics .
Some typical examples include around 15 to 20 % loading of chalk in uPVC drain pipe , 5 to 15 % loading of stearate coated chalk or marble in uPVC window profile .
PVC cables can use calcium carbonate at loadings of up to 70 phr -LRB- parts per hundred parts of resin -RRB- to improve mechanical properties -LRB- tensile strength and elongation -RRB- and electrical properties -LRB- volume resistivity -RRB- .
Polypropylene compounds are often filled with calcium carbonate to increase rigidity , a requirement that becomes important at high use temperatures .
It also routinely used as a filler in thermosetting resins -LRB- Sheet and Bulk moulding compounds -RRB- and has also been mixed with ABS , and other ingredients , to form some types of compression molded `` clay '' Poker chips .
Fine ground calcium carbonate is an essential ingredient in the microporous film used in babies ' diapers and some building films as the pores are nucleated around the calcium carbonate particles during the manufacture of the film by biaxial stretching .
Calcium carbonate is also used in a wide range of trade and DIY adhesives , sealants , and decorating fillers .
Ceramic tile adhesives typically contain 70 to 80 % limestone .
Decorating crack fillers contain similar levels of marble or dolomite .
It is also mixed with putty in setting stained glass windows , and as a resist to prevent glass from sticking to kiln shelves when firing glazes and paints at high temperature .
Calcium carbonate is known as whiting in ceramics /glazing applications , where it is used as a common ingredient for many glazes in its white powdered form .
When a glaze containing this material is fired in a kiln , the whiting acts as a flux material in the glaze .
In North America , calcium carbonate has begun to replace kaolin in the production of glossy paper .
Europe has been practicing this as alkaline papermaking or acid-free papermaking for some decades .
Carbonates are available in forms : ground calcium carbonate -LRB- GCC -RRB- or precipitated calcium carbonate -LRB- PCC -RRB- .
The latter has a very fine and controlled particle size , on the order of 2 micrometres in diameter , useful in coatings for paper .
It is used in swimming pools as a pH corrector for maintaining alkalinity `` buffer '' to offset the acidic properties of the disinfectant agent .
It is commonly called chalk as it has been a major component of blackboard chalk .
Chalk may consist of either calcium carbonate or gypsum , hydrated calcium sulfate CaSO4Â·2H2O .
Ground calcium carbonate is further used as an abrasive -LRB- both as scouring powder and as an ingredient of household scouring creams -RRB- , in particular in its calcite form , which has the relatively low hardness level of 3 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness , and will therefore not scratch glass and most other ceramics , enamel , bronze , iron , and steel , and have a moderate effect on softer metals like aluminium and copper .
Health and dietary applications
500 milligram calcium supplements made from calcium carbonate
Calcium carbonate is widely used medicinally as an inexpensive dietary calcium supplement or antacid .
It may be used as a phosphate binder for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia -LRB- primarily in patients with chronic renal failure -RRB- .
It is also used in the pharmaceutical industry as an inert filler for tablets and other pharmaceuticals .
Calcium carbonate is used in the production of toothpaste and is also used in homeopathy as one of the constitutional remedies .
Excess calcium from supplements , fortified food and high-calcium diets , can cause the `` milk alkali syndrome , '' which has serious toxicity and can be fatal .
In 1915 , Bertram Sippy introduced the `` Sippy regimen '' of hourly ingestion of milk and cream , and the gradual addition of eggs and cooked cereal , for 10 days , combined with alkaline powders , which provided symptomatic relief for peptic ulcer disease .
Over the next several decades , the Sippy regimen resulted in renal failure , alkalosis , and hypercalemia , mostly in men with peptic ulcer disease .
These adverse effects were reversed when the regimen stopped , but it was fatal in some patients with protracted vomiting .
Milk alkali syndrome declined in men after effective treatments for peptic ulcer disease .
But during the past 15 years , it has been reported in women taking calcium supplements above the recommended range of 1200 to 1500 mg daily , for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis , and is exacerbated by dehydration .
Calcium has been added to over-the-counter products , which contributes to inadvertent excessive intake .
Excessive calcium intake can lead to hypercalcemia , complications of which include vomiting , abdominal pain and altered mental status .
A form of food additive is designated as E170 .
It is used in some soy milk products as a source of dietary calcium ; one study suggests that calcium carbonate might be as bioavailable as the calcium in cow 's milk .
Environmental applications
In 1989 , a researcher , Ken Simmons , introduced CaCO3 into the Whetstone Brook in Massachusetts .
His hope was that the calcium carbonate would counter the acid in the stream from acid rain and save the trout that had ceased to spawn .
Although his experiment was a success , it did increase the amounts of aluminium ions in the area of the brook that was not treated with the limestone .
This shows that CaCO3 can be added to neutralize the effects of acid rain in river ecosystems .
Currently calcium carbonate is used to neutralize acidic conditions in both soil and water..
Since the 1970s , such liming has been practiced on a large scale in Sweden to mitigate acidification and several thousand lakes and streams are limed repeatedly .
Calcination equilibrium
Calcination of limestone using charcoal fires to produce quicklime has been practiced since antiquity by cultures all over the world .
The temperature at which limestone yields calcium oxide is usually given as 825 Â°C , but stating an absolute threshold is misleading .
Calcium carbonate exists in equilibrium with calcium oxide and carbon dioxide at any temperature .
At each temperature there is a partial pressure of carbon dioxide that is in equilibrium with calcium carbonate .
At room temperature the equilibrium overwhelmingly favors calcium carbonate , because the equilibrium CO2 pressure is only a tiny fraction of the partial CO2 pressure in air , which is about 0.035 k Pa .
At temperatures above 550 Â°C the equilibrium CO2 pressure begins to exceed the CO2 pressure in air .
So above 550 Â°C , calcium carbonate begins to outgas CO2 into air .
But in a charcoal fired kiln , the concentration of CO2 will be much higher than it is in air .
Indeed if all the oxygen in the kiln is consumed in the fire , then the partial pressure of CO2 in the kiln can be as high as 20 k Pa .
The table shows that this equilibrium pressure is not achieved until the temperature is nearly 800 Â°C .
For the outgassing of CO2 from calcium carbonate to happen at an economically useful rate , the equilibrium pressure must significantly exceed the ambient pressure of CO2 .
And for it to happen rapidly , the equilibrium pressure must exceed total atmospheric pressure of 101 k Pa , which happens at 898 Â°C .
Solubility
With varying CO2 pressure
Calcium carbonate is poorly soluble in pure water -LRB- 47 mg/L at normal atmospheric CO2 partial pressure as shown below -RRB- .
The equilibrium of its solution is given by the equation -LRB- with dissolved calcium carbonate on the right -RRB- :
where the solubility product for -LSB- Ca2+ -RSB- -LSB- CO32â -RSB- is given as anywhere from Ksp = 3.7Ã10â9 to Ksp = 8.7Ã10â9 at 25 Â°C , depending upon the data source .
What the equation means is that the product of molar concentration of calcium ions -LRB- moles of dissolved Ca2+ per liter of solution -RRB- with the molar concentration of dissolved CO32â can not exceed the value of Ksp .
This seemingly simple solubility equation , however , must be taken along with the more complicated equilibrium of carbon dioxide with water -LRB- see carbonic acid -RRB- .
Some of the CO32â combines with H+ in the solution according to :
HCO3â is known as the bicarbonate ion .
Calcium bicarbonate is many times more soluble in water than calcium carbonateâindeed it exists only in solution .
Some of the HCO3â combines with H+ in solution according to :
Some of the H2CO3 breaks up into water and dissolved carbon dioxide according to :
And dissolved carbon dioxide is in equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide according to :
For ambient air , is around 3.5Ã10â4 atmospheres -LRB- or equivalently 35 Pa -RRB- .
The last equation above fixes the concentration of dissolved CO2 as a function of , independent of the concentration of dissolved CaCO3 .
At atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 , dissolved CO2 concentration is 1.2Ã10â5 moles/liter .
The equation before that fixes the concentration of H2CO3 as a function of -LSB- CO2 -RSB- .
For -LSB- CO2 -RSB- =1.2x10-5 , it results in -LSB- H2CO3 -RSB- =2.0x10-8 moles per liter .
When -LSB- H2CO3 -RSB- is known , the remaining three equations together with
-LRB- which is true for all aqueous solutions -RRB- , and the fact that the solution must be electrically neutral ,
2 -LSB- Ca2+ -RSB- + -LSB- H+ -RSB- = -LSB- HCO3â -RSB- + 2 -LSB- CO32â -RSB- + -LSB- OHâ -RSB-
make it possible to solve simultaneously for the remaining five unknown concentrations -LRB- note that the above form of the neutrality equation is valid only if calcium carbonate has been put in contact with pure water or with a neutral pH solution ; in the case where the origin water solvent pH is not neutral , the equation is modified -RRB- .
The table on the right shows the result for -LSB- Ca2+ -RSB- and -LSB- H+ -RSB- -LRB- in the form of pH -RRB- as a function of ambient partial pressure of CO2 -LRB- Ksp = 4.47Ã10â9 has been taken for the calculation -RRB- .
1 -RRB- At atmospheric levels of ambient CO2 the table indicates the solution will be slightly alkaline with a maximum CaCO3 solubility of 47 mg/L .
2 -RRB- As ambient CO2 partial pressure is reduced below atmospheric levels , the solution becomes more and more alkaline .
At extremely low , dissolved CO2 , bicarbonate ion , and carbonate ion largely evaporate from the solution , leaving a highly alkaline solution of calcium hydroxide , which is more soluble than CaCO3 .
Note that for = 10â12 atm , the -LSB- Ca2+ -RSB- -LSB- OH- -RSB- 2 product is still below the solubility product of Ca -LRB- OH -RRB- 2 -LRB- 8Ã10â6 -RRB- .
For still lower CO2 pressure , Ca -LRB- OH -RRB- 2 precipitation will occur before CaCO3 precipitation .
3 -RRB- As ambient CO2 partial pressure increases to levels above atmospheric , pH drops , and much of the carbonate ion is converted to bicarbonate ion , which results in higher solubility of Ca2+ .
The effect of the latter is especially evident in day to day life of people who have hard water .
Water in aquifers underground can be exposed to levels of CO2 much higher than atmospheric .
As such water percolates through calcium carbonate rock , the CaCO3 dissolves according to the second trend .
When that same water then emerges from the tap , in time it comes into equilibrium with CO2 levels in the air by outgassing its excess CO2 .
The calcium carbonate becomes less soluble as a result and the excess precipitates as lime scale .
This same process is responsible for the formation of stalactites and stalagmites in limestone caves .
Two hydrated phases of calcium carbonate , monohydrocalcite , CaCO3Â·H2O and ikaite , CaCO3Â·6H2O , may precipitate from water at ambient conditions and persist as metastable phases .
With varying pH
We now consider the problem of the maximum solubility of calcium carbonate in normal atmospheric conditions -LRB- = 3.5 Ã 10â4 atm -RRB- when the pH of the solution is adjusted .
This is for example the case in a swimming pool where the pH is maintained between 7 and 8 -LRB- by addition of sodium bisulfate NaHSO4 to decrease the pH or of sodium bicarbonate NaHCO3 to increase it -RRB- .
From the above equations for the solubility product , the hydratation reaction and the two acid reactions , the following expression for the maximum -LSB- Ca2+ -RSB- can be easily deduced :
showing a quadratic dependence in -LSB- H+ -RSB- .
The numerical application with the above values of the constants gives
Comments :
decreasing the pH from 8 to 7 increases the maximum Ca2+ concentration by a factor 100 .
Water with a pH maintained to 7 can dissolve up to 15.9 g/L of CaCO3 .
This explains the high Ca2+ concentration in some mineral waters with pH close to 7 .
note that the Ca2+ concentration of the previous table is recovered for pH = 8.27
keeping the pH to 7.4 in a swimming pool -LRB- which gives optimum HClO/ClOâ ratio in the case of `` chlorine '' maintenance -RRB- results in a maximum Ca2+ concentration of 1010 mg/L .
This means that successive cycles of water evaporation and partial renewing may result in a very hard water before CaCO3 precipitates -LRB- water with a Ca2+ concentration above 120 mg/L or 30 Â°F is considered very hard -RRB- .
Addition of a calcium sequestring agent or complete renewing of the water will solve the problem .
Solubility in a strong or weak acid solution
Solutions of strong -LRB- HCl -RRB- or weak -LRB- acetic , sorbic , lactic , phosphoric -RRB- acids are commercially available .
They are commonly used as descaling agents to remove limescale deposits .
The maximum amount of CaCO3 that can be `` dissolved '' by one liter of an acid solution can be calculated using the above equilibrium equations .
In the case of a strong monoacid with decreasing acid concentration -LSB- A -RSB- = -LSB- Aâ -RSB- , we obtain -LRB- with CaCO3 molar mass = 100 g -RRB- :
where the initial state is the acid solution with no Ca2+ -LRB- not taking into account possible CO2 dissolution -RRB- and the final state is the solution with saturated Ca2+ .
For strong acid concentrations , all species have a negligible concentration in the final state with respect to Ca2+ and Aâ so that the neutrality equation reduces approximately to 2 -LSB- Ca2+ -RSB- = -LSB- Aâ -RSB- yielding .
When the concentration decreases , -LSB- HCO3â -RSB- becomes non negligible so that the preceding expression is no longer valid .
For vanishing acid concentrations , we recover the final pH and the solubility of CaCO3 in pure water .
In the case of a weak monoacid -LRB- here we take acetic acid with pKA = 4.76 -RRB- with decreasing total acid concentration -LSB- A -RSB- = -LSB- Aâ -RSB- + -LSB- AH -RSB- , we obtain :
We see that for the same total acid concentration , the initial pH of the weak acid is less acid than the one of the strong acid ; however , the maximum amount of CaCO3 which can be dissolved is approximately the same .
This is because in the final state , the pH is larger that the pKA , so that the weak acid is almost completely dissociated , yielding in the end as many H+ ions as the strong acid to `` dissolve '' the calcium carbonate .
The calculation in the case of phosphoric acid -LRB- which is the most widely used for domestic applications -RRB- is more complicated since the concentrations of the four dissociation states corresponding to this acid must be calculated together with -LSB- HCO3â -RSB- , -LSB- CO32â -RSB- , -LSB- Ca2+ -RSB- , -LSB- H+ -RSB- and -LSB- OHâ -RSB- .
The system may be reduced to a seventh degree equation for -LSB- H+ -RSB- the numerical solution of which gives
where -LSB- A -RSB- = -LSB- H3PO4 -RSB- + -LSB- H2PO4â -RSB- + -LSB- HPO42â -RSB- + -LSB- PO43â -RSB- is the total acid concentration .
We see that phosphoric acid is more efficient than a monoacid since at the final almost neutral pH , the second dissociated state concentration -LSB- HPO42â -RSB- is not negligible -LRB- see phosphoric acid -RRB- .

Michel Foucault
Michel Foucault -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- 15 October 1926 â 25 June 1984 -RRB- was a French philosopher , historian , critic and sociologist .
He held a chair at the CollÃ¨ge de France with the title `` History of Systems of Thought , '' and also taught at the University of California , Berkeley .
Foucault is best known for his critical studies of social institutions , most notably psychiatry , medicine , the human sciences , and the prison system , as well as for his work on the history of human sexuality .
Foucault 's work on power , and the relationships between power , knowledge , and discourse has been widely discussed .
In the 1960s Foucault was often associated with the structuralist movement .
Foucault later distanced himself from structuralism .
While Foucault was always typically characterized by the post-structuralist and postmodernist labels , he personally rejected the postmodernist and post-structuralist labels , preferring to classify his thought as a critical history of modernity , rooted in Kant .
Early life
Foucault was born on 15 October 1926 in Poitiers as Paul-Michel Foucault to a notable provincial family .
His father , Paul Foucault , was an eminent surgeon and hoped his son would join him in the profession .
His early education was a mix of success and mediocrity until he attended the Jesuit CollÃ¨ge Saint-Stanislas , where he excelled .
During this period , Poitiers was part of Vichy France and later came under German occupation .
After World War II , Foucault was admitted to the prestigious Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure -LRB- rue d'Ulm -RRB- , the traditional gateway to an academic career in the humanities in France .
The École Normale Supérieur
Foucault 's personal life during the Ãcole Normale was difficultâhe suffered from acute depression .
As a result , he was taken to see a psychiatrist .
During this time , Foucault became fascinated with psychology .
He earned a license -LRB- degree -RRB- in psychology , a very new qualification in France at the time , in addition to a degree in philosophy , in 1952 .
He was involved in the clinical arm of psychology , which exposed him to thinkers such as Ludwig Binswanger .
Foucault joined the French Communist Party from 1950 to 1953 .
He was inducted into the party by his mentor Louis Althusser , but soon became disillusioned with both the politics and the philosophy of the party .
Various people , such as historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie , have reported that Foucault never actively participated in his cell , unlike many of his fellow party members .
Early career
Foucault failed at the agrÃ©gation in 1950 but took it again and succeeded the following year .
After a brief period lecturing at the Ãcole Normale , he took up a position at the UniversitÃ© Lille Nord de France , where from 1953 to 1954 he taught psychology .
In 1954 Foucault published his first book , Maladie mentale et personnalitÃ© , a work which he would later disavow .
At this point , Foucault was not interested in a teaching career , and he undertook a lengthy exile from France .
In 1954 he served France as a cultural delegate to the University of Uppsala in Sweden -LRB- a position arranged for him by Georges DumÃ©zil , who was to become a friend and mentor -RRB- .
In 1958 Foucault left Uppsala for briefly held positions at Warsaw University and at the University of Hamburg .
Foucault returned to France in 1960 to complete his doctorate and take up a post in philosophy at the University of Clermont-Ferrand .
There he met philosopher Daniel Defert , who would become his lover of twenty years .
In 1961 he earned his doctorate by submitting two theses -LRB- as is customary in France -RRB- : a `` major '' thesis entitled Folie et dÃ©raison : Histoire de la folie Ã  l'Ã¢ge classique -LRB- Madness and Insanity : History of Madness in the Classical Age -RRB- and a ` secondary ' thesis which involved a translation of , and commentary on Kant 's Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View .
Folie et dÃ©raison -LRB- Madness and Insanity â published in an abridged edition in English as Madness and Civilization and finally published unabridged as `` History of Madness '' by Routledge in 2006 -RRB- was extremely well-received .
Foucault continued a vigorous publishing schedule .
In 1963 he published Naissance de la Clinique -LRB- Birth of the Clinic -RRB- , Raymond Roussel , and a reissue of his 1954 volume -LRB- now entitled Maladie mentale et psychologie or , in English , `` Mental Illness and Psychology '' -RRB- which he would again disavow .
After Defert was posted to Tunisia for his military service , Foucault moved to a position at the University of Tunis in 1965 .
He published Les Mots et les choses -LRB- The Order of Things -RRB- during the height of interest in structuralism in 1966 , and Foucault was quickly grouped with scholars such as Jacques Lacan , Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss , and Roland Barthes as the newest , latest wave of thinkers set to topple the existentialism popularized by Jean-Paul Sartre .
Foucault made a number of skeptical comments about Marxism , which outraged a number of left wing critics , but later firmly rejected the ` structuralist ' label .
He was still in Tunis during the May 1968 student riots , where he was profoundly affected by a local student revolt earlier in the same year .
In the Autumn of 1968 he returned to France , where he published L'archÃ©ologie du savoir -LRB- The Archaeology of Knowledge -RRB- â a methodological response to his critics â in 1969 .
Post-1968 : as activist
In the aftermath of 1968 , the French government created a new experimental university , Paris VIII , at Vincennes and appointed Foucault the first head of its philosophy department in December of that year .
Foucault appointed mostly young leftist academics -LRB- such as Judith Miller -RRB- whose radicalism provoked the Ministry of Education , who objected to the fact that many of the course titles contained the phrase `` Marxist-Leninist '' , and who decreed that students from Vincennes would not be eligible to become secondary school teachers .
Foucault notoriously also joined students in occupying administration buildings and fighting with police .
Foucault 's tenure at Vincennes was short-lived , as in 1970 he was elected to France 's most prestigious academic body , the CollÃ¨ge de France , as Professor of the History of Systems of Thought .
His political involvement increased , and his partner Defert joined the ultra- Maoist Gauche Proletarienne -LRB- GP -RRB- .
Foucault helped found the Prison Information Group -LRB- or GIP -RRB- to provide a way for prisoners to voice their concerns .
This coincided with Foucault 's turn to the study of disciplinary institutions , with a book , Surveiller et Punir -LRB- Discipline and Punish -RRB- , which `` narrates '' the micro-power structures that developed in Western societies since the eighteenth century , with a special focus on prisons and schools .
Later life
In the late 1970s , political activism in France tailed off with the disillusionment of many left wing intellectuals .
A number of young Maoists abandoned their beliefs to become the so-called New Philosophers , often citing Foucault as their major influence , a status about which Foucault had mixed feelings .
Foucault in this period embarked on a six-volume project The History of Sexuality , which he never completed .
Its first volume was published in French as La VolontÃ© de Savoir -LRB- 1976 -RRB- , then in English as The History of Sexuality : An Introduction -LRB- 1978 -RRB- .
The second and third volumes did not appear for another eight years , and they surprised readers by their subject matter -LRB- classical Greek and Latin texts -RRB- , approach and style , particularly Foucault 's focus on the subject , a concept that some mistakenly believed he had previously neglected .
Foucault began to spend more time in the United States , at the University at Buffalo -LRB- where he had lectured on his first ever visit to the United States in 1970 -RRB- and especially at UC Berkeley .
In 1975 he took LSD at Zabriskie Point in Death Valley National Park , later calling it the best experience of his life .
In 1979 Foucault made two tours of Iran , undertaking extensive interviews with political protagonists in support of the new interim government established soon after the Iranian Revolution .
His many essays on Iran , published in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera , only appeared in French in 1994 and then in English in 2005 .
These essays caused some controversy , with some commentators arguing that Foucault was insufficiently critical of the new regime .
In the philosopher 's later years , interpreters of Foucault 's work attempted to engage with the problems presented by the fact that the late Foucault seemed in tension with the philosopher 's earlier work .
When this issue was raised in a 1982 interview , Foucault remarked `` When people say , ` Well , you thought this a few years ago and now you say something else , ' my answer is ...
-LSB- laughs -RSB-
` Well , do you think I have worked hard all those years to say the same thing and not to be changed ? ' ''
He refused to identify himself as a philosopher , historian , structuralist , or Marxist , maintaining that `` The main interest in life and work is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning '' .
In a similar vein , he preferred not to claim that he was presenting a coherent and timeless block of knowledge ; he rather desired his books `` to be a kind of tool-box which others can rummage through to find a tool which they can use however they wish in their own area ...
I don't write for an audience , I write for users , not readers . ''
Foucault died of an AIDS -related illness in Paris on 25 June , 1984 .
He was the first high-profile French personality who was reported to have AIDS .
Little was known about the disease at the time and there has been some controversy since .
In the front-page article of Le Monde announcing his death , there was no mention of AIDS , although it was implied that he died from a massive infection .
Prior to his death , Foucault had destroyed most of his manuscripts and in his will prohibited the publication of what he might have overlooked .
Works
Madness and Civilization
The English edition of Madness and Civilization is an abridged version of Folie et dÃ©raison : Histoire de la folie Ã  l'Ã¢ge classique , originally published in 1961 .
A full English translation titled The History of Madness has since been published by Routledge in 2006 .
This was Foucault 's first major book , mostly written while he was the Director of the Maison de France in Sweden .
It examines ideas , practices , institutions , art and literature relating to madness in Western history .
Foucault begins his history in the Middle Ages , noting the social and physical exclusion of lepers .
He argues that with the gradual disappearance of leprosy , madness came to occupy this excluded position .
The ship of fools in the 15th century is a literary version of one such exclusionary practice , namely that of sending mad people away in ships .
In 17th century Europe , in a movement which Foucault famously describes as the Great Confinement , `` unreasonable '' members of the population were locked away and institutionalised .
In the eighteenth century , madness came to be seen as the reverse of Reason , and , finally , in the nineteenth century as mental illness .
Foucault also argues that madness was silenced by Reason , losing its power to signify the limits of social order and to point to the truth .
He examines the rise of scientific and `` humanitarian '' treatments of the insane , notably at the hands of Philippe Pinel and Samuel Tuke who he suggests started the conceptualization of madness as ` mental illness ' .
He claims that these new treatments were in fact no less controlling than previous method .
Pinel 's treatment of the mad amounted to an extended aversion therapy , including such treatments as freezing showers and use of a straitjacket .
In Foucault 's view , this treatment amounted to repeated brutality until the pattern of judgment and punishment was internalized by the patient .
The Birth of the Clinic
Foucault 's second major book , The Birth of the Clinic : An Archaeology of Medical Perception -LRB- Naissance de la clinique : une archÃ©ologie du regard mÃ©dical -RRB- was published in 1963 in France , and translated to English in 1973 .
Picking up from Madness and Civilization , The Birth of the Clinic traces the development of the medical profession , and specifically the institution of the clinique -LRB- translated as `` clinic '' , but here largely referring to teaching hospitals -RRB- .
Its motif is the concept of the medical regard -LRB- translated by Alan Sheridan as `` medical gaze `` -RRB- , traditionally limited to small , specialized institutions such as hospitals and prisons , but which Foucault examines as subjecting wider social spaces , governing the population en masse .
Death and The Labyrinth
Death and the Labyrinth : The World of Raymond Roussel was published in 1963 , and translated into English in 1986 .
It is unique , being Foucault 's only work on literature .
For Foucault this was `` by far the book I wrote most easily and with the greatest pleasure . ''
Here , Foucault explores theory , criticism and psychology through the texts of Raymond Roussel , one of the fathers of experimental writing , whose work has been celebrated by the likes of Cocteau , Duchamp , Breton , Robbe-Grillet , Gide and Giacometti .
The Order of Things
Foucault 's Les Mots et les choses .
Une archÃ©ologie des sciences humaines was published in 1966 .
It was translated into English and published by Pantheon Books in 1970 under the title The Order of Things : An Archaeology of the Human Sciences .
Foucault had preferred L'Ordre des Choses for the original French title , but changed the title as there was already another book of this title .
The book opens with an extended discussion of Diego VelÃ¡zquez ` s painting Las Meninas and its complex arrangement of sight-lines , hiddenness and appearance .
Then it develops its central claim : that all periods of history have possessed specific underlying conditions of truth that constituted what was acceptable as , for example , scientific discourse .
Foucault argues that these conditions of discourse have changed over time , in major and relatively sudden shifts , from one period 's episteme to another .
Foucault 's Nietzschean critique of Enlightenment values in Les mots et les choses has been very influential to cultural history , It is here Foucault 's infamous claims that `` man is only a recent invention '' and that the `` end of man '' is at hand .
The book made Foucault a prominent intellectual figure in France .
The Archaeology of Knowledge
Published in 1969 , this volume was Foucault 's main excursion into methodology , written as an appendix of sorts to Les Mots et les choses .
It makes references to Anglo-American analytical philosophy , particularly speech act theory .
Foucault directs his analysis toward the `` statement '' -LRB- Ã©noncÃ© -RRB- , the basic unit of discourse .
`` Statement '' has a very special meaning in the Archaeology : it denotes that which makes propositions , utterances , or speech acts meaningful .
In contrast to classic structuralists , Foucault does not believe that the meaning of semantic elements is determined prior to their articulation .
In this understanding , statements themselves are not propositions , utterances , or speech acts .
Rather , statements constitute a network of rules establishing what is meaningful , and these rules are the preconditions for propositions , utterances , or speech acts to have meaning .
However , statements are also ` events ' , because , like other rules , they appear at some time .
Depending on whether or not it complies with these rules of meaning , a grammatically correct sentence may still lack meaning and , inversely , a grammatically incorrect sentence may still be meaningful .
Statements depend on the conditions in which they emerge and exist within a field of discourse ; the meaning of a statement is reliant on the succession of statements that precede and follow it .
Foucault aims his analysis towards a huge organised dispersion of statements , called discursive formations .
Foucault reiterates that the analysis he is outlining is only one possible procedure , and that he is not seeking to displace other ways of analysing discourse or render them as invalid .
According to Dreyfus and Rabinow , Foucault not only brackets out issues of truth -LRB- cf. Husserl -RRB- , he also brackets out issues of meaning .
Rather than looking for a deeper meaning underneath discourse or looking for the source of meaning in some transcendental subject , Foucault analyzes the discursive and practical conditions of the existence for truth and meaning .
In order to show the principles of meaning and truth production in various discursive formations he details how truth claims emerge during various epochs on the basis of what was actually said and written during these periods of time .
He particularly describes the Renaissance , the Age of Enlightenment , and the 20th century .
He strives to avoid all interpretation and to depart from the goals of hermeneutics .
This does not mean that Foucault denounces truth and meaning , but just that truth and meaning depend on the historical discursive and practical means of truth and meaning production .
For instance , although they were radically different during Enlightenment as opposed to Modernity , there were indeed meaning , truth and correct treatment of madness during both epochs -LRB- Madness and Civilization -RRB- .
This posture allows Foucault to denounce a priori concepts of the nature of the human subject and focus on the role of discursive practices in constituting subjectivity .
Dispensing with finding a deeper meaning behind discourse appears to lead Foucault toward structuralism .
However , whereas structuralists search for homogeneity in a discursive entity , Foucault focuses on differences .
Instead of asking what constitutes the specificity of European thought he asks what constitutes the differences developed within it and over time .
Therefore , as a historical method , he refuses to examine statements outside of their historical context : the discursive formation .
The meaning of a statement depends on the general rules that characterises the discursive formation to which it belongs .
A discursive formation continually generates new statements , and some of these usher in changes in the discursive formation that may or may not be adopted .
Therefore , to describe a discursive formation , Foucault also focuses on expelled and forgotten discourses that never happen to change the discursive formation .
Their difference to the dominant discourse also describe it .
In this way one can describe specific systems that determine which types of statements emerge .
In his Foucault -LRB- 1986 -RRB- , Deleuze describes The Archaeology of Knowledge as `` the most decisive step yet taken in the theory-practice of multiplicities . ''
Discipline and Punish
Discipline and Punish : The Birth of the Prison was translated into English in 1977 , from the French Surveiller et punir : Naissance de la prison , published in 1975 .
The book opens with a graphic description of the brutal public execution in 1757 of Robert-FranÃ§ois Damiens , who attempted to kill Louis XV .
Against this it juxtaposes a colourless prison timetable from just over 80 years later .
Foucault then inquires how such a change in French society 's punishment of convicts could have developed in such a short time .
These are snapshots of two contrasting types of Foucault 's `` Technologies of Punishment '' .
The first type , `` Monarchical Punishment '' , involves the repression of the populace through brutal public displays of executions and torture .
The second , `` Disciplinary Punishment , '' is what Foucault says is practiced in the modern era .
Disciplinary punishment gives `` professionals '' -LRB- psychologists , programme facilitators , parole officers , etc. -RRB- power over the prisoner , most notably in that the prisoner 's length of stay depends on the professionals ' judgment .
Foucault also compares modern society with Jeremy Bentham ` s `` Panopticon `` design for prisons -LRB- which was unrealized in its original form , but nonetheless influential -RRB- : in the Panopticon , a single guard can watch over many prisoners while the guard remains unseen .
The dark dungeon of pre-modernity has been replaced with the bright modern prison , but Foucault cautions that `` visibility is a trap '' .
It is through this visibility , Foucault writes , that modern society exercises its controlling systems of power and knowledge -LRB- terms which Foucault believed to be so fundamentally connected that he often combined them in a single hyphenated concept , `` power-knowledge `` -RRB- .
Increasing visibility leads to power located on an increasingly individualized level , shown by the possibility for institutions to track individuals throughout their lives .
Foucault suggests that a `` carceral continuum '' runs through modern society , from the maximum security prison , through secure accommodation , probation , social workers , police , and teachers , to our everyday working and domestic lives .
All are connected by the -LRB- witting or unwitting -RRB- supervision -LRB- surveillance , application of norms of acceptable behaviour -RRB- of some humans by others .
The History of Sexuality
Three volumes of The History of Sexuality were published before Foucault 's death in 1984 .
The first and most referenced volume , The Will to Knowledge -LRB- previously known as An Introduction in English â Histoire de la sexualitÃ© , 1 : la volontÃ© de savoir in French -RRB- was published in France in 1976 , and translated in 1977 , focusing primarily on the last two centuries , and the functioning of sexuality as an analytics of power related to the emergence of a science of sexuality -LRB- scientia sexualis -RRB- and the emergence of biopower in the West .
In this volume he attacks the `` repressive hypothesis , '' the widespread belief that we have , particularly since the nineteenth century , `` repressed '' our natural sexual drives .
He proposes that what is thought of as `` repression '' of sexuality actually constituted sexuality as a core feature of human identities , and produced a proliferation of discourse on the subject .
The second two volumes , The Use of Pleasure -LRB- Histoire de la sexualite , II : l'usage des plaisirs -RRB- and The Care of the Self -LRB- Histoire de la sexualitÃ© , III : le souci de soi -RRB- dealt with the role of sex in Greek and Roman antiquity .
Both were published in 1984 , the year of Foucault 's death , with the second volume being translated in 1985 , and the third in 1986 .
In his lecture series from 1979 to 1980 Foucault extended his analysis of government to its ` wider sense of techniques and procedures designed to direct the behaviour of men ' , which involved a new consideration of the ` examination of conscience ' and confession in early Christian literature .
These themes of early Christian literature seemed to dominate Foucault 's work , alongside his study of Greek and Roman literature , until the end of his life .
However , Foucault 's death left the work incomplete , and the planned fourth volume of his History of Sexuality on Christianity was never published .
The fourth volume was to be entitled Confessions of the Flesh -LRB- Les aveux de la chair -RRB- .
The volume was almost complete before Foucault 's death and a copy of it is privately held in the Foucault archive .
It can not be published under the restrictions of Foucault 's estate .
Lectures
From 1970 until his death in 1984 , from January to March of each year except 1977 , Foucault gave a course of public lectures and seminars weekly at the CollÃ¨ge de France as the condition of his tenure as professor there .
All these lectures were tape-recorded , and Foucault 's transcripts also survive .
In 1997 these lectures began to be published in French with six volumes having appeared so far .
So far , six sets of lectures have appeared in English : Psychiatric Power 1973â1974 , Abnormal 1974â1975 , Society Must Be Defended 1975â1976 , Security , Territory , Population 1977â1978 , The Hermeneutics of the Subject 1981â1982 and The Birth of Biopolitics 1978-1979 .
Society Must Be Defended and Security , Territory , Population pursued an analysis of the broader relationship between security and biopolitics , explicitly politicizing the question of the birth of man raised in The Order of Things .
In Security , Territory , Population , Foucault outlines his theory of governmentality , and demonstrates the distinction between sovereignty , discipline , and governmentality as distinct modalities of state power .
He argues that governmental state power can be genealogically linked to the 17th century state philosophy of raison d'etat and , ultimately , to the medieval Christian ` pastoral ' concept of power .
Notes of some of Foucault 's lectures from University of California , Berkeley in 1983 have also appeared as Fearless Speech .

Raster graphics
Imagine the smiley face in the top left corner as an RGB bitmap image .
When enlarged , it might look like the big smiley face to the right .
Every square represents a pixel .
Zooming in further , the individual pixels can be analyzed , with their colors constructed by adding the values for red , green and blue .
In computer graphics , a raster graphics image or bitmap , is a data structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels , or points of color , viewable via a monitor , paper , or other display medium .
Raster images are stored in image files with varying formats -LRB- see Comparison of graphics file formats -RRB- .
A bitmap corresponds bit -for-bit with an image displayed on a screen , generally in the same format used for storage in the display 's video memory , or maybe as a device-independent bitmap .
A bitmap is technically characterized by the width and height of the image in pixels and by the number of bits per pixel -LRB- a color depth , which determines the number of colors it can represent -RRB- .
The printing and prepress industries know raster graphics as contones -LRB- from `` continuous tones '' -RRB- and refer to vector graphics as `` line work '' .
Etymology
The word `` raster '' has its origins in the Latin -LRB- a rake -RRB- , which is derived from -LRB- to scrape -RRB- , and was originally used in the raster scan of cathode ray tubes -LRB- CRT -RRB- , which paint the image line by line ; it is used for a grid of pixels by generalization .
See also rastrum , a device for drawing musical staff lines .
Resolution
Raster graphics are resolution dependent .
They can not scale to an arbitrary resolution without loss of apparent quality .
This deficiency contrasts with the capabilities of vector graphics , which easily scale to the quality of the device rendering them .
Raster graphics deal more practically than vector graphics with photographs and photo-realistic images , while vector graphics often serve better for typesetting or for graphic design .
Modern computer-monitors typically display about 72 to 130 pixels per inch -LRB- PPI -RRB- , and some modern consumer printers can resolve 2400 dots per inch -LRB- DPI -RRB- or more ; determining the most appropriate image resolution for a given printer-resolution can pose difficulties , since printed output may have a greater level of detail than a viewer can discern on a monitor .
Typically , a resolution of 150 to 300 pixel per inch works well for 4-color process -LRB- CMYK -RRB- printing .
Raster-based image editors
Raster-based image editors , such as Photoshop and GIMP , revolve around editing pixels , unlike vector-based image editors , such as CorelDRAW , Adobe Illustrator , or Inkscape , which revolve around editing lines and shapes -LRB- vectors -RRB- .
When an image is rendered in a raster-based image editor , the image is composed of millions of pixels .
At its core , a raster image editor works by manipulating each individual pixel .
Most pixel-based image editors work using the RGB color model , but some also allow the use of other color models such as the CMYK color model .

Biography
Basil Wright was the first recruit to join John Grierson at the Empire Marketing Board ` s film unit in 1930 , shortly after he graduated from Cambridge University .
Wright 's 1934 film Song of Ceylon is his most celebrated work .
Shot on location in Ceylon -LRB- now Sri Lanka -RRB- the film was completed with the composer Walter Leigh at the GPO Film Unit in London .
At the GPO , Wright acted as producer and wrote the script for Night Mail -LRB- 1936 -RRB- for which he received a joint directorial credit with Harry Watt .
Wright had introduced his friend W. H. Auden to the film unit and the poetâs verse was included in the film .
Wright left the GPO to form his own production company , The Realist Film Unit -LRB- RFU -RRB- .
There he directed Children at School with money from the Gas Industry and The Face of Scotland for The Films of Scotland Committee .
During World War II , Wright worked only as a producer , first at John Grierson ` s Film Centre before joining The Crown Film Unit between 1945 and 1946 as producer-in-charge .
Among the best known films he produced for Crown are Humphrey Jennings ` A Diary for Timothy -LRB- 1946 -RRB- and A Defeated People -LRB- 1946 -RRB- .
Returning to direction in the early 1950s , his films included Waters of Time -LRB- 1951 -RRB- made for the Festival of Britain , World Without End -LRB- 1953 -RRB- directed with Paul Rotha for UNESCO and Greece : The Immortal Land -LRB- 1958 -RRB- in collaboration with his friend the artist Michael Ayrton .
Writing throughout the 30s and 40s , Basil Wright had contributed to the theoretical development of documentary in the movementâs journals Cinema Quarterly , World Film News and Documentary Newsletter .
He was the film critic for The Spectator after Graham Greene left .
Wright was a regular contributor to the British Film Institute âs Sight and Sound during the 1940s and ` 50s .
He published a small book : The Uses of Film -LRB- 1948 -RRB- and his personal -LRB- extensive -RRB- history of cinema The Long View -LRB- 1974 -RRB- .
He taught at the University of Southern California -LRB- 1962 and 1968 -RRB- , The National Film and Television School in London -LRB- 1971-73 -RRB- and Temple University in Phipadelphia -LRB- 1977-78 -RRB- .
He was Governor of the British Film Institute , a fellow of the British Film Academy and President of the International Association of Documentary Filmmakers .
In his films Wright combined an ability to look closely and carefully at a subject with a poetic and often experimental approach to editing and sound .
In Britain he is commemorated with a film prize awarded biennially by the Royal Anthropological Institute .
Centenary celebrations
In honor of Basil Wright 's centenary year , his career , and the careers of his colleagues and fellow centenarians : Edgar Anstey , Marion Grierson , Humphrey Jennings and Paul Rotha , were celebrated with a season of films between August and October 2007 at the British Film Institute in London .
Following season of films the Bfi released a four disc DVD set Land of Promise containing films from leading figures in the British Documentary Film movement .

Holy Trinity Icon
Russian icon of the Old Testament Trinity by Andrey Rublev , between 1408-25
The Holy Trinity is an important subject of iconographic representation in Eastern Orthodox Christianity .
There are two different types of Holy Trinity icons : the Old Testament Trinity and the New Testament Trinity -LRB- Троица Ветхозаветная and Троица Новозаветная in Russian -RRB- .
Old Testament Trinity
The Old Testament Trinity subject is best known from the famous icon painted by St Andrey Rublev -LRB- created sometime between 1408 and 1425 -RRB- .
This icon is actually more properly called the `` Hospitality of Abraham '' -LRB- see Genesis 18 -RRB- .
The appearance of the three angels to Abraham at Mamre was a type of the Holy Trinity , not an appearance of the Holy Trinity itself .
There is only one hypostasis , the Divine Logos , Jesus Christ in the form of an angel and two angels .
New Testament Trinity
Greek Orthodox fresco of the `` New Testament Trinity ''
The New Testament Trinity , derived from Western models , and only appearing in Orthodox art after the Fall of Constantinople , depicts the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit distinctly .
The Father is painted as a white-bearded man with a very special type of nimbus -LRB- it contains two rombic figures : one is red , another is blue -RRB- .
The Holy Spirit is shown as a white dove with a halo of the same type as Father has .
The dove may be placed between the Father and the Son -LRB- if they sit near each other at the same level -RRB- , or the dove may be shown in a beam of light from the mouth of the Father , as if the Holy Spirit was just sent by Him .
Christ may be shown either as an adult , -LRB- in this case he is sitting right from His Father -RRB- or as an infant -LRB- in this case he is sitting on His Father 's knees -RRB- .
The name of this type of icon is also called Paternity .
It is interesting that in Russian Orthodoxy , depictions of God the Father are prohibited .
However , when the movement of antitrinitrarians became strong in medieval Novgorod , a new type of iconography appeared : Spas Vethiy Denmi -LRB- The Savior Old with Days -RRB- .
In this type of icon , Jesus Christ is depicted as an old white-haired man .
The basis of this iconography is that Jesus is saying that He and the Father are one .
This very image of God the Father is used in New Testament Trinity icons .
Nevertheless , according to the Synodic Act of the Seventh Ecumenical Synod , this icon remains heretical .
The Second Council of Nicea in 787 confirmed that the depiction of Christ was allowed because he became man ; the situation regarding the Father was less clear .
The usual Orthodox representation of the Trinity was through the `` Old Testament Trinity '' of the three angels visiting Abraham - said in the text to be `` the Lord '' -LRB- Genesis : 18.1-15 -RRB- .
However post-Byzantine representations similar to those in the West are not uncommon in the Greek world .
The subject long remained sensitive , and the Russian Orthodox Church at the Great Synod of Moscow in 1667 finally forbade depictions of the Father in human form , although other Orthodox churches may not follow this ruling .
The canon is quoted in full here because it explains the Russian Orthodox theology on the subject :
Chapter 2 , Â§44 : It is most absurd and improper to depict in icons the Lord Sabaoth -LRB- that is to say , God the Father -RRB- with a grey beard and the Only-Begotten Son in His bosom with a dove between them , because no-one has seen the Father according to His Divinity , and the Father has no flesh , nor was the Son born in the flesh from the Father before the ages .
And though David the prophet says , `` From the womb before the morning star have I begotten Thee '' -LRB- Ps.109 : 3 -RRB- , that birth was not fleshly , but unspeakable and incomprehensible .
For Christ Himself says in the holy Gospel , `` No man hath seen the Father , save the Son '' -LRB- cf. -RRB- .
And Isaiah the prophet says in his fortieth chapter : `` To whom have ye likened the Lord ?
and with what likeness have ye made a similitude of Him ?
Has not the artificier of wood made an image , or the goldsmiths , having melted gold , gilt it over , and made it a similitude ? ''
-LRB- -RRB- .
In like manner the Apostle Paul says in the Acts -LRB- -RRB- , `` Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone , graven by art of man 's imagination . ''
And John Damascene says : `` But furthermore , who can make a similitude of the invisible , incorporeal , uncircumscribed and undepictable God ?
It is , then , uttermost insanity and impiety to give a form to the Godhead '' -LRB- Orthodox Faith , 4 : 16 -RRB- .
In like manner St. Gregory the Dialogist prohibits this .
For this reason we should only form an understanding in the mind of Sabaoth , which is the Godhead , and of that birth before the ages of the Only-Begotten-Son from the Father , but we should never , in any wise depict these in icons , for this , indeed , is impossible .
And the Holy Spirit is not in essence a dove , but in essence he is God , and `` No man hath seen God '' , as John the Theologian and Evangelist bears witness -LRB- -RRB- and this is so even though , at the Jordan at Christ 's holy Baptism the Holy Spirit appeared in the likeness of a dove .
For this reason , it is fitting on this occasion only to depict the Holy Spirit in the likeness of a dove .
But in any other place those who have intelligence will not depict the Holy Spirit in the likeness of a dove .
For on Mount Tabor , He appeared as a cloud and , at another time , in other ways .
Furthermore , Sabaoth is the name not only of the Father , but of the Holy Trinity .
According to Dionysios the Areopagite , Lord Sabaoth , translated from the Jewish tongue , means `` Lord of Hosts '' .
This Lord of Hosts is the Holy Trinity , Father , Son and Holy Spirit .
And although Daniel the prophet says that he beheld the Ancient of Days sitting on a throne , this should not be understood to refer to the Father , but to the Son , Who at His second coming will judge every nation at the dreadful Judgment .
Modern Romanian icon of the Old Testament Trinity closely follows Rublev 's iconography
The New Testament Trinity subject may be actually introduced into any icon where the Christ is shown : for this purpose the painter needs only to add the Father and the dove at the upper side of the icon .
The New Testament Trinity is not popular in official Orthodoxy in Russia nowadays , though it was popular in Novgorod earlier .
Among Popovtsy Old Believers this type of an icon is very widespread , since the New Testament Trinity is depicted above any crucifixion icon -LRB- without the Son , since he is on the Cross in this case -RRB- .
The New Testament Trinity also appears on the wonder-working icon of Our Lady of Kursk -LRB- also without the Son , since in this case Mary holds him on her knees -RRB- .

Velabrum
The Velabrum is the low valley in the city of Rome that connects the Forum with the Forum Boarium , and the Capitoline Hill with the western slope of the Palatine Hill .
Before the construction of the Cloaca Maxima , which probably follows the course of an ancient stream , the area was a swamp .
Ancient authorities state that the roots of a fig tree growing in this swamp caught and stopped the basket carrying Romulus and Remus as it floated along on the Tiber current .
The place therefore has a high symbolic significance .
Even after the Cloaca was built , the area was still prone to flooding from the Tiber , until the ground level was raised after the Neronian fire .
It is the site of the Arch of Janus , the Arcus Argentariorum and the church San Giorgio al Velabro .

Kenny Jönsson
Per Anders Kenny JÃ¶nsson -LRB- born October 6 , 1974 -RRB- is a Swedish professional ice hockey player playing for RÃ¶gle BK of the Swedish Elitserien .
Playing career
JÃ¶nsson was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1st round as the 12th overall selection in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft .
After playing with the Toronto club during the 1994â95 lockout shortened season , he was traded midway through the 1995â96 season to the New York Islanders in a player exchange which brought highly popular former captain Wendel Clark back to Toronto .
JÃ¶nsson has spent most of his career as a professional player with the Islanders .
After playing with the Swedish second division team RÃ¶gle BK , where he started his career , during the 2004â05 NHL lockout , he announced in the summer of 2005 that he was staying with the club for the 2005â06 season .
JÃ¶nsson played with the Islanders from 1996 through 2004 .
Fans and journalists considered JÃ¶nsson one of the most underrated defensemen in the league during his time in the NHL .
He played good positional defense and had sound offensive skills as well , but his quiet demeanor and low-key playing style kept him below the radar of some observers .
During the 1998â99 NHL season , JÃ¶nsson was named captain of the Islanders .
After almost one season , he stepped down and ultimately , was succeeded by Michael Peca .
He was voted Best Defender of the Tournament at the 2006 Winter Olympics where Sweden won the gold medal .
This was quite surprising considering he had spent a season in the Swedish second division , while most of the other players played in the NHL .
His brother JÃ¶rgen is also a well-known Swedish ice hockey player .
During IHWC 2006 World Championship , with brother JÃ¶rgen initially sidlined by injury , he was named captain of the Swedish national team .

PGPfone
PGPfone was a secure voice telephony system developed by Philip Zimmermann in 1995 .
The PGPfone protocol had little in common with Zimmermann 's popular PGP email encryption package , except for the use of the name .
It used ephemeral Diffie-Hellman protocol to establish a session key , which was then used to encrypt the stream of voice packets .
The two parties compared a short authentication string to detect a Man-in-the-middle attack , which is the most common method of wiretapping secure phones of this type .
PGPfone could be used point-to-point -LRB- with two modems -RRB- over the public switched telephone network , or over the Internet as an early Voice over IP system .
The Internet was not yet ready for PGPfone Â­in 1996 .
There were no protocol standards for Voice over IP .
A decade later , Zimmermann released the successor to PGPfone , Zfone and ZRTP , a new and better secure VoIP protocol based on modern VoIP standards .
Zfone builds on the ideas of PGPfone .
According to the MIT PGPfone web page `` MIT is no longer distributing PGPfone .
Given that the software has not been maintained since 1997 , we doubt it would run on most modern systems . ''
