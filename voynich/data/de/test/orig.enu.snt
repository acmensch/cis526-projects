Oldsmobile 88
The Oldsmobile 88 -LRB- a.k.a. Eighty-Eight -RRB- was a full-size car sold by the Oldsmobile division of General Motors and produced from 1949 until 1999 .
From 1950 to 1974 the 88 was the division 's top-selling line , particularly the entry-level models such as the 88 and Dynamic 88 .
The 88 series was also an image leader for Oldsmobile , particularly in the early years -LRB- 1949â51 -RRB- when it was one of the best performing automobiles thanks to its relatively small size , light weight and advanced overhead-valve high-compression V8 engine originally designed for the larger and more luxurious 98 series but dropped into the smaller six-cylinder Oldsmobile 76 body , creating what was considered the granddaddy of the musclecars of the 1960s .
A large number of variations in nomenclature were seen over this long model runâDelmont , Delta , Dynamic , Jetstar , Starfire , Super , Holiday , L/S , LSS , Celebrity , and Royale were used at various times with the 88 badge , and Fiesta appeared on some station wagons in the 1950s and 1960s .
The name was more commonly shown as numbers in the earlier years -LRB- `` Delta 88 '' , for example -RRB- and was changed to spell-out `` Eighty Eight '' starting in 1989 .
The Oldsmobile Eighty Eight was produced in Wentzville , Missouri ; Flint , Michigan ; and Lake Orion , Michigan .
1949-1953
Oldsmobile introduced the 88 badge in 1949 .
It was named to complement the already-existing 76 and 98 .
The new car used the six-cylinder 76 's A-body platform with a powerful new Rocket V8 engine .
This combination of a relatively small light body and large , powerful engine made it a precursor to the muscle car .
The Rocket 88 vaulted Oldsmobile from a somewhat staid , conservative car to a performer that became the one to beat on the NASCAR -LRB- National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing -RRB- circuits .
It won six of the nine NASCAR late-model division races in 1949 , 10 of 19 in 1950 , 20 of 41 in 1952 , and eventually eclipsed by the low-slung , powerful Hudson Hornet , but it was still the first real `` King of NASCAR . ''
This led to increased sales to the public .
There was a pent up demand for new cars in the fast-expanding post World War II economy , and the 88 appealed to many ex-military personnel who were young and had operated powerful military equipment .
The 88 enjoyed a great success , inspiring a popular 1950s slogan , `` Make a Date with a Rocket 88 '' , and also a song , `` Rocket 88 `` , often considered the first rock and roll record .
Starting with the trunk-lid emblem of the 1950 model , Oldsmobile would adopt the rocket as its logo , and the 88 name would remain in the Olds lineup until the late 1990s , almost until the end of Oldsmobile itself .
Styling changes for the 1950 model include the replacement of a two-piece windshield with a one-piece unit and the addition of the Holiday hardtop coupe to the line .
Also a three-speed manual transmission with column shift became available as a `` delete for credit '' option to the Hydra-Matic automatic transmission .
The 88 now outsold the six-cylinder 76 lineup , which was dropped entirely after the 1950 model year .
For 1951 , the 88 was now the entry-level Olds with the discontinuation of the six-cylinder 76 line , which meant that all Oldsmobiles were powered by Rocket V8s .
New this year was the more upscale Super 88 line which included a more luxurious interior than the base 88 and used the slightly larger GM B-body with wheelbase shared with the Buick Special as opposed to the standard 88 's A-body , which would be dropped after this year .
In 1952 , the base 88 would share the Super 88s B-body and get a Rocket V8 with two-barrel carburetor while Super 88s got a more powerful 303 with a new four-barrel carburetor .
Other mechanical features were unchanged with styling changes amounting to new grilles , tailights , and interior revisions .
For 1953 , the base 88 was renamed the DeLuxe 88 for only this one year while the Super 88 continued as a more upscale version .
Engines and transmission offerings were the same as 1952 .
Late in the 1953 model year , a fire destroyed GM 's Hydra-Matic plant in Livonia , Michigan , which was then the only source for Hydra-Matic transmissions .
The temporary loss of Hydra-Matic production led Oldsmobile to build thousands of its 1953 models with Buick 's two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmissions until GM pressed its Willow Run Transmission plant into service to resume Hydra-Matic production .
New options this year included Frigidaire air conditioning , power steering , and power brakes .
1954-56
The 1954 Oldsmobiles were completely restyled with new longer and lower bodyshells and wrap-around windshields and rear windows .
Wheelbases increased to .
Base models reverted back to being simply called 88s after being designated as DeLuxe 88s for only one year and the Super 88 was once again the mid-line series .
The Rocket V8 was enlarged from 303 to 324 cubic inches with 88s powered by a two-barrel , unit while Super 88s came with a version with four-barrel carburetor .
The 1955 models were heavily facelifted with new grillework , taillights and bodyside chrome .
Horsepower for the 324 cubic-inch Rocket V8 increased to 185 for 88s and 202 for Super 88s .
At mid-year , Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body , dubbed the Holiday sedan , in both the 88 and Super 88 series .
1956 Holiday 88
For 1956 , styling highlights included a new split grille in front and revised tailights and deck along with revised side chroming .
Horsepower for the 324 Rocket V8 increased to 230 for 88s and 240 for Super 88s .
A new four-speed Jetaway Hydra-Matic was introduced this year to replace the original Hydra-Matic transmission that Olds used since 1940 .
The new Jetaway Hydra-Matic retained the four forward speeds and fluid coupling unit , but added a new `` Park '' position to the shift quadrant and no longer required band adjustment as a specified routine maintenance .
Inside , an oval speedometer replaced the round unit and a new foot-operated parking brake replaced the previous T-handle unit .
1957-58
For 1957 only , the basic 88 was officially named Golden Rocket 88 , taken from Olds ' 1956 Motorama two-passenger show car .
However , the only badging was an `` 88 '' underneath each taillight .
Also for 1957 the `` J2 '' option was offered , with three carburetors , similar to the Pontiac Tri-Power .
The Super 88 continued as the upscale mid-line series .
Under the hood , the Rocket V8 increased in displacement to 371 cubic inches and for all models across the board .
Styling highlights were more evolutional than radical overall with three-piece rear window styling utilized on some models .
Oldsmobile revived station wagons for the first time since 1950 with the Super 88 Fiesta being a four-door hardtop design .
1958 Oldsmobile Super 88
The 1958 model is best known in Oldsmobile as the year of the `` ChromeMobile '' thanks to tremendous splatterings of chrome trim on the body , particularly on the higher-priced Super 88 and Ninety-Eight models .
The styling was advertised by Olds as the `` Mobile Look . ''
The Dynamic 88 debuted in 1958 and lasted through 1966 positioned as the entry level model below the Super 88 .
This model featured a more economical Rocket V8 than its more expensive linemates - a detuned version of the 371 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with two-barrel carburetion .
Super 88 models were powered by a four-barrel version of that engine as standard equipment with a J-2 option featuring three two-barrel carburetors and .
A new option for 1958 was a `` Sportable '' radio that could be removed from the instrument panel through the glove compartment and used as a portable radio for beaches , picnics , etc. thanks to portable batteries .
A revised instrument panel was highlighted by a new deep-dish steering wheel with `` horn bars '' replacing the long-standing horn ring still common during that period .
Despite an economic recession that cut into new car sales industrywide , and especially affected the medium-priced car market that Olds competed in , Oldsmobile saw only a slight decline in sales for 1958 and even rose in industry standings to fourth-place behind the `` Low-Priced Three '' of Chevrolet , Ford and Plymouth , while surpassing a now-floundering sister division Buick on the sales charts for the first time in many years .
Oldsmobile was also way ahead of other middle-priced competitors such as sister division Pontiac , Mercury , Dodge and Chrysler , along with Ford Motor Company 's all-new and ill-fated Edsel , and Chrysler Corporation 's DeSoto - the latter two nameplates of which would fade into oblivion within the next three years .
1959-1960
All Oldsmobiles were completely restyled for 1959 with a longer , lower and wider body on the basic GM B-body , which for the first time was used on all of General Motors ' standard-sized cars from the lowest-priced Chevrolet to the most-expensive Cadillac .
Styling highlights for the new models , promoted as the `` Linear Look , '' included six-window styling on four-door pillared sedans , glassy semi-fastback rooflines on Holiday coupes and flat-blade rooflines with thin windshield and C-pillars on Holiday sedans which created a `` fishbowl '' -like effect .
While many 1959 model cars featured bigger and sharper fins , Olds featured more subdued `` oval '' fins and far less chrome than the ` 58 model for a much cleaner look .
Wheelbases on 88 models increased by one inch to .
A larger 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetion and rated at was standard equipment on the Super 88 .
The lower-priced Dynamic 88 series was powered by 371 cubic-inch Rocket V8 carried over from 1957-58 rated at with two-barrel carburetion , or optional four-barrel version rated at .
A major facelift with new grille and taillights and revised rear design highlighted the 1960 Oldsmobiles .
The larger 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 continued as standard power for Super 88 models .
Dynamic 88s continued with the 371 cubic-inch Rocket V8 that was detuned to thanks to a lower compression ratio that permitted the use of lower-priced regular gasoline .
Other changes included a revised instrument panel and a slimmer transmission tunnel for improved interior space .
1961-64
An all-new body and chassis with perimeter `` Guard Beam '' frame and all-coil suspension replacing the previous leaf springs highlighted the 1961 full-sized Oldsmobiles , which were joined by the new compact F-85 .
Wheelbases remained the same as in 1960 , but overall length and width were reduced slightly .
All full-sized Oldsmobiles were now powered by the 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with the Dynamic 88 getting a two-barrel , version that used regular gas , while the Super 88 was powered by a four-barrel `` Ultra High Compression '' 394 Skyrocket V8 rated at .
The Skyrocket engine was available as an extra-cost option on the Dynamic 88 .
A new three-speed `` Roto '' Hydra-matic transmission that was smaller and lighter than the previous four-speed unit was introduced as an option .
At mid-year , a sporty and luxurious convertible called the Starfire was introduced .
It was based on the Super 88 ragtop and featured leather bucket seats , center console with floor shifter for the Hydra-matic transmission -LRB- incidentally the first U.S. full-sized production car to feature an automatic transmission with a console-mounted floor shifter -RRB- and loads of other standard items such as power steering , brakes , windows and driver 's seat .
The Starfire was also powered by an even higher-performance version of the `` Ultra High Compression '' 394 cubic-inch Starfire V8 rated at .
The 1962 88 received a minor facelift that included a revised grille and tailights , along with a new convertible-like roofline on Holiday hardtop coupes .
Length was increased somewhat to give the ` 62 Olds a longer look .
Engines were uprated to for the standard engine in the Dynamic 88 thanks to a higher compression ratio that demanded the use of premium fuel -LRB- a regular-fuel version was offered as a no-cost option -RRB- , 330 horses for the `` Skyrocket '' V8 standard on Super 88 and Ninety-Eight and 345 horses for the top Starfire Rocket V8 .
Heaters became standard equipment on all models .
New , squared-off styling highlighted the 1963 full-sized Oldsmobiles .
Models and drivetrains in both the Dynamic 88 and Super 88 series were unchanged from 1962 .
New options this year included a `` Tilt-Away '' steering wheel that could be adjusted to six positions , AM/FM radio and cruise control .
For 1964 , Oldsmobile 's full-sized cars received a minor facelift that included new grilles and tailights .
New this year was the introduction of new price leader full-sized Olds series , the Jetstar 88 , which used the same basic bodyshell as other 88 models , but shared the many of the mid-size car components with the F-85 .
The Jetstar 88 used the smaller 330 V8 and Jetaway -LRB- Super Turbine 300 -RRB- two-speed automatic transmission in place of the 394 cubic-inch V8 and Hydra-Matic found in other Oldsmobiles , and 9.5 in -LRB- 241.3 mm -RRB- drum brakes which were less effective than the drums found on other full-sized Olds models including the top-selling Dynamic 88 , the plusher and more powerful Super 88 and the larger and more luxurious Ninety-Eight .
1964 also saw the introduction of the Jetstar I .
This model was produced for just two years and was a direct competitor to the Pontiac Grand Prix in the same $ 3,500 price range .
The Jetstar I shared the notchback body style with the Starfire along with its more powerful 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 engine but with less standard equipment and a lower price tag .
The Jetstar I is distinguishable from the Starfire and Jetstar 88 in that the rear window on the Jetstar I is concave , rather than convex .
The year 1964 was the last for the Super 88 series , which was replaced by the new Delta 88 for 1965 .
It was also the last year for Olds to offer full-sized station wagons for several years as the division introduced a new Vista Cruiser wagon in mid-1964 that featured skylights and a raised roofline over the rear seat and cargo area and offered six- or nine-passenger seating with all seats facing forward .
The Vista Cruiser was basically a stretched out version of the intermediate F-85/Cutlass wagons with a six-inch -LRB- 152 mm -RRB- longer wheelbase , making it comparable in overall size to the full-sized Chevrolet Impala and Pontiac Catalina wagons .
1965-68
The Delta name appeared for the first time in 1965 as an upscale trim line of the Dynamic 88 , the Dynamic 88 Delta , replacing the previous top-series B-body Olds , the Super 88 .
Early ` 65s were referred to as Dynamic 88 Deltas , but within a few weeks after the start of the model year , Olds began marketing the line as a separate series known as the Delta 88 .
Other full-sized Oldsmobile model lines included the low-priced Jetstar 88 , the volume-selling Dynamic 88 , sporty Jetstar I and the sporty and luxurious Starfire , all riding on a wheelbase .
All 1965 Olds models featured all new styling and engineering .
The B-body cars featured more rounded styling than previous years with Coke-bottle profiles and semi-fastback rooflines on Holiday -LRB- two-door hardtop -RRB- coupes - Jetstar I and Starfire coupes got a more rounded variation of the squared-off 1963-64 roofline with concave rear window shared by Pontiac 's Grand Prix .
Also introduced this year was a new 425 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 with horsepower ratings ranging from 300 to 370 depending on carburetion and compression ratio .
The new three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission with torque converter replaced the original Hydra-Matic transmission used by Olds since its 1940 introduction .
Also new to the option list for 1965 on all B-body cars was a four-speed manual transmission with Hurst floor shifter , which was a seldom-ordered offering .
Few styling changes other than revised grilles and tail sections marked the 1966 full-sized Oldsmobiles .
The sporty Jetstar I series was dropped with a lower-priced Starfire only offered as a hardtop coupe taking its place .
All other series ' 88 models were carried over from 1965 with a new convertible added to the Delta 88 line and the same bodystyle dropped from the Jetstar 88 line .
A new option for all Olds 88 -LRB- as well as Ninety-Eight and the new front-drive Toronado -RRB- models was GM 's automatic Comfortron Air Conditioning system first introduced by Cadillac in 1964 that permitted the driver to automatically set a year-round temperature at a constant level .
The basic Frigidaire air conditioning unit offered in previous years continued as before and becoming an increasingly popular option on full-sized Oldsmobiles .
Another new option for 1966 was a Tilt-and-Telescopic steering wheel that could be vertically adjusted to six different positions as well as telescoped outward from the instrument panel to improve driver comfort .
The Delmont 88 was introduced for 1967 and produced for just two years .
It replaced both the Jetstar 88 and Dynamic 88 , featuring the 330 V8 as standard and the 425 V8 as an option .
The 425 was standard on the Delta 88 .
The Delta 88 gained a new subseries called the Delta Custom which had a plusher interior than the standard Delta 88 featuring a Strato bench seat in the Holiday -LRB- 4-door hardtop -RRB- sedan or , in the Holiday -LRB- 2-door hardtop -RRB- coupe , a choice of either Strato bucket seats with console or Strato bench seat with armrest .
The Delta Custom Holiday Coupe was essentially a successor to the former 88-based Starfire series offered in previous years -LRB- 1961-66 -RRB- but with a standard 88 semi-fastback roofline rather than the Starfire 's squared off roof with concave rear window .
New options for 1967 included front disc brakes , stereo 8-track tape player and a Climate Combustion Control system for Rocket V8s designed to regulate carburetor air temperature , boost fuel economy , speed choke warm up and eliminate winter icing to permit easier starting and more efficient operation in cold weather .
More rounded styling cues marked all 1967 Olds 88 models which received longer hoods and shorter decks and more sweeping fastback rooflines on 88 Holiday coupes to emulate the styling of Olds ' front-wheel-drive flagship , the Toronado .
The same assortment of 330 and 425 cubic-inch V8 engines were carried over from 1966 , as were most transmission offerings except the optional four-speed manual with Hurst shifter , which was discontinued due to low buyer interest .
New front end with split grille design that would become an Olds trademark in coming years highlighted all 1968 full-sized Oldsmobiles with horizontal lines on 88 's and egg-crate patterns on Ninety-Eights , along with concealed windshield wipers .
The Delmont 88 got a larger 350 cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment and the optional V8 that was standard on Delta 88/Custom and Ninety-Eight was jacked up to 455 cubic inches with a W-33 option primarily designed as part of the division 's police package available as an RPO on all 88 's .
Horsepower ratings of other Olds engines included 250 for the 350 two-barrel standard in the Delmont 88 , 310 for the four-barrel 350 optional in the Delmont 88 .
A 455 two-barrel rated at was standard on the Delta 88/Custom and optional on the Delmont 88 .
Optional on all 88s was a four-barrel 455 rated at from the larger C-body Ninety-Eight .
Both the 350 and 455 two-barrel Rocket V8 engines were designed to use regular gasoline while the optional 350 and 455 four-barrel carbureted `` Ultra High Compression '' Super Rocket V8s required premium fuel .
1969-1970
The 1969 88 series dropped the Delmont name , leaving the Delta 88 as the base model of the series .
The Royale trim appeared on a top-line Holiday coupe and came standard with a more luxurious interior featuring a notchback vinyl upholstered bench seat with armrest or Strato bucket seats with optional center console .
For safety , a ceiling mounted shoulder belt was offered in the front seats for both the driver and right passenger .
This arrangement provided five belt buckles in the front bench seat .
The standard engine in the base Delta 88 was a 350 cubic-inch 9.0 to 1 low compression ratio Rocket V8 with a Rochester two-barrel carburetor that was rated at @ 4600 rpm and of torque ran on leaded regular 94 RON gasoline .
Standard on the Delta 88 Custom and Royale models and optional on the base series was a low compression two-barrel version of the 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 rated at designed to use regular fuel .
Optional on all Delta 88s was the four-barrel Ultra High Compression 455 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 rated at .
Top option was the version of the four-barrel 455 V8 designed to run on 98 RON octane fuel available in all Delta 88 models as the W-33 option .
The two-speed Jetaway automatic that was previously offered as an option on the smaller engine 88 models was dropped completely in favor of the GM three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 transmission previously only offered with the larger engines .
Also a new GM-designed Variable-Ratio Power Steering system was introduced as an option .
All full-sized Oldsmobiles were completely restyled for 1969 with more squared off bodylines and rooflines for the Holiday coupes and sedans replacing the semi-fastback look of 1967-68 , and ventless front windows on all models .
Wheelbases were increased by one-inch to .
Though the 1969 models were extensively restyled , the basic 1965 chassis design and inner-body structure was retained along with the roofline on the pillared four-door Town sedans .
Inside , headrests were now standard equipment and a new instrument panel included square instruments replacing the round instruments of previous years along with a push-button operated ashtray and rotary glove compartment knob .
The high-beam lights indicator was a red rocket located on the dash .
Also new was a steering column-mounted ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel when not in use - a feature found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars , a year before locking steering columns were required by federal mandate starting in 1970 .
Only detail changes were made for the 1970 full-sized Oldsmobiles including a new split grille that no longer extended to surround the headlights and slightly revised rear section .
Powertrain selections were carried over from 1969 with both 350 and 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8s now featuring `` Positive Valve Rotators '' for longer engine life and more efficient operation .
A new antenna impregnated into the windshield was introduced this year that replaced the previous fender-mounted unit and was included as standard equipment on all cars equipped with a factory radio .
New option this year was a wiper/washer switch mounted in the shift lever knob .
Optional radio was a stereo AM-FM radio and a lower dash mounted eight track tape player .
1971-76
All GM B-body full-size cars were completely restyled and enlarged for 1971 , but continued to ride on a wheelbase .
It was available as a pillared four-door Town Sedan , two- and four-door Holiday hardtops and a convertible .
Series models for 1971 included the base Delta 88 , Delta 88 Custom and Delta 88 Royale , the latter inheriting the convertible body style previously offered on the base Delta 88 .
All models received fuselage styling somewhat similar to what Chrysler Corporation introduced on its 1969 models , and new rooflines with a more squared off greenhouse for Town sedans and more rounded lines for Holiday sedans and coupes - the latter receiving reverting back to a semi-fastback format .
Also new for 1971 was the Custom Cruiser station wagon , the first full-sized Olds wagon since 1964 .
It used the 88 's B-body platform with a longer wheelbase -LRB- matching the larger C-body Ninety-Eight -RRB- with multi-leaf spring suspensions that differed entirely from the all-coil suspensions used in sedans and coupes .
The Custom Cruiser came standard with the larger 455 Rocket V8 and utilized the disappearing clamshell tailgate of other fullsize GM wagons .
Engine offerings again included 350 and 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8s ranging from 250 to 340 gross horsepower , all of which featured lowered compression ratios beginning in 1971 to enable use of lower octane regular leaded 91 RON octane , low-lead or unleaded gasoline .
Vented power front disc brakes were now standard equipment on all 88 models and beginning midway through the 1971 model year , Variable-Ratio power steering and Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission were added to the standard equipment list .
Other highlights for 1971 included a wrap-around instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models -LRB- Toronados had a slightly smoother upper leading edge design -RRB- that was highlighted by a large square speedometer and all controls within easy reach of the driver , and a one-year only Flo-Through ventilation system that utilized vents in the trunklid .
The system used on all GM B- , C- and E-body cars and the Chevrolet Vega , used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake , and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate .
In theory , passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped , as in heavy traffic .
In practice , however , it didn't work .
Within weeks of the 1971 models ' debut , however , Oldsmobile -- and all other GM dealers -- received multiple complaints from drivers who complained the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up -- and could not be shut off .
The ventilation system was extensively revised for 1972 .
For 1972 , the Delta Custom series was dropped and the Royale series was expanded to include four-door Town and Holiday sedans .
Advertised brake horsepower figures dropped to 155 for the base 350 two-barrel and 250 for the optional 455 four-barrel Rocket V8s thanks to an industry-wide switch in power measurements from the previous gross method -LRB- as measured by a dynamometer with no accessories attached -RRB- to the net method in which the power measurements were based upon an engine `` as installed '' in a vehicle with all emission controls and accessories hooked up .
Only minor trim changes were made this year that included revised `` waterfall '' grilles in front and four-segment tailights in the rear .
Inside a revised `` Flo-Through '' ventilation system utilizing vents in the doorjams replaced the 1971 version which utilized vents in the trunklid .
For 1973 , wider and lower split waterfall grilles flanked a new federally-mandated front bumper on all Delta 88 models and larger one-piece rounded rectangular tailights replaced the four-segmented lights of 1972 .
Engine offerings included a standard 350 Rocket V8 with two-barrel carburetor -LRB- 150 net horsepower -RRB- or optional 455 Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetion and with single exhaust or with dual exhausts .
Model offerings were the same as 1972 with the Delta 88 Royale series now including the sole Olds convertible offering .
In 1974 , a rear bumper was added and tailights reverted back to a four segment design similar to 1972 and the front grilles were narrowed and raised to hood level similar to 1971-72 models .
Also , new rooflines were featured on Holiday hardtop coupes with fixed triangular side windows replacing roll-down windows of previous years .
As Oldsmobile completely discontinued two-barrel carbureted engines this year , a new 350 four-barrel Rocket V8 -LRB- 175 horsepower -RRB- became standard equipment with the 455 available as an option .
Other highlights this year included an all-new flat instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models with horizontal sweep speedometer and `` Message Center '' system of warning lights replacing the wrap-around dash of previous years .
A new and seldom-ordered option available on all full-sized Olds models and Toronados was a driver 's side airbag - among the first to be offered in a production automobile .
The Delta 88 Royale ragtop was again the only convertible offered by Olds .
Detail changes for 1975 included revised grilles and taillights along with new rear quarter windows for pillared and Holiday sedans - the latter 's design similar to an opera window .
The same assortment of 350 and 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8s were still offered along with a one-year-only -LRB- and seldom-ordered -RRB- option of a Pontiac-built 400 cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor and rating .
All engines were hooked up to a catalytic converter that not only mandated the use of unleaded gasoline but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems .
1975 was the final year for the Delta 88 Royale convertible , the last of which was built on June 11 , 1975 .
Just under 7200 Delta 88 Royale convertibles were built in 1975 as Oldsmobile made a concerted effort to target the convertible buyer market at the time .
The headline on a print ad for a 1975 Olds Delta 88 Royale convertible stated , `` Today a beautiful Olds convertible .
Tomorrow , a collector 's item '' .
The featured car in the ad was a red Delta 88 Royale rag top .
For 1976 , the final year of this generation , all Olds 88s received revised grille work , rectangular headlamps and parking lamps directly below instead of in the bumper , with Delta 88 Royale models also getting spring-loaded stand-up hood ornaments .
It was also the final year for the Holiday hardtop coupes and sedans , along with the 455 Rocket V8 and the optional airbag system that would generally become universal on production cars and trucks some 15 years later .
A one-year only option on Delta 88 Royale Holiday coupes was the Royale Crown Landau package that included a stainless steel roof bar , padded rear quarter vinyl roof , special hood ornament and color-keyed wheelcovers .
1977-1985
1977 Delta 88 coupe
The 1977 Delta 88s and other GM B-body cars were considerably downsized from their predecessors in length and wheelbase -LRB- 116 inches - the same as the four-door 1973-77 A-body Cutlass models -RRB- and nearly lighter in weight , with curb weights dropping to between 3,500 and 3,600 pounds depending on model .
Interior roominess and trunk space , however , were not adversely affected ; in fact , many dimensions such as headroom and legroom increased substantially .
Both base Delta 88 and Royale models were now only offered in two pillared body styles ; a two-door coupe and a four-door Town Sedan .
The 1977-1979 Custom Cruiser was now based on the Delta 88 's B-body rather than the Ninety-Eight 's C-body , and came with a two-way tailgate replacing the previous clamshell tailgate of 1971-76 models , and had the same all-coil suspension as the B-body 88 sedans and coupes rather than the multi-leaf springs of previous models .
The standard engine was now a 231 cid Buick V6 with a Turbo-Hydramatic 200 transmission .
An Olds 260 was the base V8 , followed by either a Chevrolet 350 -LRB- LM1 -RRB- or Olds 350 -LRB- L34 -RRB- .
Initially , the Oldsmobile engine came in California and high-altitude cars , the Chevrolet engine came in cars with Federal emissions equipment .
The Olds engine returned later in the model year .
Oldsmobile 's new 403 was the top engine option and came with a THM350 transmission .
This situation was well publicized as the `` Chevymobile Affair '' and GM ultimately settled with affected Oldsmobile owners by offering `` extended '' warranties for the `` Chevy-powered '' Oldsmobiles , or the option of returning those cars in exchange for a `` real '' Olds with a Rocket V8 - however , the latter option was not often exercised due to the fact the owner had to pay GM back money based on the number of miles his or her `` Chevymobile '' was driven , which could become a very expensive proposition .
This began the era of `` corporate '' engines , and for many years GM advertisements would include a disclaimer stating ` `` Oldsmobiles -LRB- or other divisions ' -RRB- are equipped with engines manufactured by various GM divisions , subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide . '' '
As in previous years , base Delta 88 and Royale models differed mainly in exterior and interior trim .
Base Deltas had a full bench seat available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery , while Royales had a notchback bench seat with armrest or optional 60/40 notchback bench , also available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl trim .
All 88s featured an all-new instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer and heater/air conditioning controls moved to the center of the dash above the radio from the left side of the dash , and continued with the `` Message Center '' bank of warning lights .
The new dash was highlighted with woodgrain trim .
The dimmer switch moved from the floor to the turn-signal lever .
For 1978 , a Holiday 88 coupe was added to the lineup , featuring Strato bucket seats along with console and floor shifter , Super Stock wheels and two-tone paint schemes .
All 88 models received new grilles and revised tailights with drivetrains the same as 1977 except for the addition of the 350 Diesel V8 to the option list .
The year 1979 saw the addition of a new Delta 88 Royale Brougham series added to the line , which included plush `` pillowed '' seat trim similar to the Ninety-Eight .
All models again received revised grilles and other minor changes .
It was the last year for the 403 V8 as federal fuel-economy mandates spelled the end of larger engines in order to meet those requirements .
For 1980 , all 88s got new and more aerodynamic sheetmetal for improved fuel economy highlighted by rounded square tailights similar to mid-70s 88s , but overall dimensions stayed the same and coupes received a revised roofline .
New to the engine lineup was the 307 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetor and .
All other engines except the now-discontinued 403 were carried over from 1979 .
Only minor grille and tailight lens revisions highlighted the 1981 Delta 88s .
The gasoline 350 Rocket V8 was dropped from the option list , leaving only the diesel version available .
All other engines including the Buick 231 V6 and Olds 260 and 307 Rocket V8s were continued .
All gasoline engines received GM 's new Computer Command Control engine management system .
This system was the forerunner , and surprisingly similar to today 's OBDII which is standard on all cars sold in the United States .
The system read various parameters such as vehicle speed , throttle position , engine RPM 's , coolant temperature , and the oxygen content of the exhaust to provide the correct air/fuel mixture for any given driving condition .
Also new for 1981 was GM 's Turbo-Hydramatic 200-4R transmission , which added an overdrive gear to contribute to fuel economy and engine longevity .
The sporty Holiday 88 coupe was offered for the last time this year .
The year 1982 saw only minor trim changes for Delta 88 , Royale and Royale Brougham models .
The same assortment of engines/transmissions were carried over from previous years though the small 260 V8 was offered for the last time .
1983 Oldsmobile Delta 88 coupe
For 1983 , all Olds 88s received new grilles , hood ornaments and minor trim revisions including new steering wheels .
This would be the last year for the base Delta 88 line , leaving only the Royale and Royale Brougham after this year .
Engine offerings were down to three , a standard Buick 231 cubic-inch V6 , or optional Oldsmobile V8s including the 307 Rocket and 350 Diesel .
For 1984 , all Delta 88s were now Royale or Royale Brougham models .
Styling highlights included new grille inserts and red and amber tailights replacing the red lenses .
At mid-year , a new Royale Brougham LS was added to the 88 line almost simultaneous to the introduction of a new and downsized 1985 front-wheel drive Ninety-Eight .
With the Ninety-Eight being downsized and converted to front-drive , the Royale Brougham LS model of the 88 was now the largest and most luxurious rear-wheel drive car offered by Olds .
Custom Cruiser wagons continued with the same styling changes found on other 88 models .
Only minor changes marked the 1985 model , which was in its last year before a major downsizing and conversion to front-wheel-drive .
The same assortment of models in the Royale , Brougham and Brougham LS continued as before .
The ` 85 88s would be the last full-sized Oldsmobile sedans and coupes to feature rear-wheel-drive , Rocket V8 power , and body-on-frame construction .
Though the 88 sedans and coupes were downsized and switched to front-drive for 1986 , the Custom Cruiser station wagons would continue virtually unchanged through the 1990 model year and eventually become the only Oldsmobile models powered by an Olds Rocket V8 engine , for which production ended in 1990 after 42 years .
1986-1991
For 1986 , the Delta 88 switched platforms from the GM B platform to the relatively smaller front-wheel drive H platform , with a wheelbase of only .
The headlights changed from square sealed beam quads to integrated regular/high beam composite lamps in 1987 .
In 1989 , the `` Delta '' name was dropped , as was the hood ornament , leaving the model to simply become the `` Eighty Eight , '' now spelled out instead of using the `` 88 '' in numerical form .
The Eighty Eight was given a mild facelift in 1990 , eschewing the former chromed grille for a body-colored fascia with four slots and the Oldsmobile Rocket logo .
In the rear , new taillights and backup lights extended across the body ; once again , chrome trim was deleted .
1990-1991 Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight Royale
The model range during this time was the standard Eighty Eight , the Eighty Eight Royale , and the Eighty Eight Royale Brougham , in ascending order .
Engines :
1986-1988.5 - 3.8 L -LRB- 231 in3 -RRB- LG3 V6
1988.5-1991 - 3.8 L -LRB- 231 in3 -RRB- 3800 LN3 V6
Transmission :
1986-1988.5 - 440-T4 4-speed automatic overdrive
1988.5-1991 - 4T60 4-speed automatic overdrive
Voice Diagnostic System
This generation of Delta 88s had an optional voice diagnostic system that alerted the driver of problems .
The voice was male and computer synthesized .
In the event of a warning , the door chime played three times rapidly and then played the voice alert .
This happened twice in case the driver missed the warning the first time .
Every alert also had corresponding light on the instrument cluster .
Warnings included :
`` The engine coolant level is low ! ''
`` The engine is overheating !
Please stop the engine and consult the owner 's manual ! ''
`` The park brake is not fully released ! ''
`` The key is in the ignition ! ''
-LRB- Upon opening the door with the key inserted into the ignition . -RRB-
`` The headlights are on ! ''
-LRB- Upon turning off the car with the headlights on . -RRB-
1992-99
The Oldsmobile Eighty Eight was redesigned for 1992 , following the redesign of the Ninety Eight the previous year .
This would prove to be the last Eighty Eight or 88 model from Oldsmobile -LRB- along with its performance LSS and Regency models -RRB- before being discontinued in 1999 with the 2001 Aurora V6 as a replacement .
The 3.8 L Buick V6 was still the only engine , but output increased to and of torque .
The Eighty-Eight 's front and rear were restyled for 1996 to bear more resemblance to the flagship Aurora .
In the 1996 model year , GM renamed the model from Eighty Eight Royale to three models -- Eighty Eight , LSS -LRB- A `` Luxury Sports Sedan '' targeted to male European car buyers , available with a supercharged V6 and a floor mounted gear shifter .
It is important to note , however , early LSS models -LRB- 1995 -RRB- were rarely equipped with the 3800 Supercharged engine .
The LSS was a originally a trim level package on the 88 starting in 1992 .
In 1996 the LSS received Aurora-inspired seats .
1996 was the final year that the original-style rocket -LRB- in black and silver -RRB- appeared on a hood emblem .
1997 would welcome the new Oldsmobile logo .
All four vehicles used the same wheelbase and shared an updated version of the H-body .
The suspension tuning , interior appointments , and certain exterior trim was used to differentiate the three models .
Engines :
1992â1994 3.8 L -LRB- 231 in3 -RRB- 3800 Series I V6 , 170 hp -LRB- 130 kW -RRB-
1995-1999 3.8 L -LRB- 231 in3 -RRB- 3800 Series II V6 , 205 hp -LRB- 155 kW -RRB-
1995 3.8 L -LRB- 231 in3 -RRB- supercharged 3800 Series I V6 , 225 hp -LRB- 170 kW -RRB-
1996-1999 3.8 L -LRB- 231 in3 -RRB- supercharged 3800 Series II V6 , 240 hp -LRB- 190 kW -RRB-
From 1992 to 1999 , the Eighty Eight was produced in Lake Orion , Michigan .

Joseph Langen
Joseph Langen -LRB- June 3 , 1837 - July 1901 -RRB- was a German theologian and priest , who was instrumental for the German Old Catholic movement .
He was born at Cologne , studied at Bonn , and was ordained priest for the Roman Catholic Church in 1859 .
He was nominated professor extraordinary at the University of Bonn in 1864 , and a professor in ordinary of the exegesis of the New Testament in 1867 -- an office which he held till his death .
He was one of the band of professors who in 1870 supported DÃ¶llinger in his resistance to the Vatican decrees , and was excommunicated along with DÃ¶llinger , Johann Nepomuk Huber , Johann Friedrich , Franz Heinrich Reusch , Joseph Hubert Reinkens and others , for refusing to accept them .
In 1878 , in consequence of the permission given to priests to marry , Langen ceased to identify himself with the Old Catholic movement , but was not reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church .
His first work was an inquiry into the authorship of the Commentary on St Paul 's Epistles and the Treatise on Biblical Questions , ascribed to Saint Ambrose and Augustine of Hippo respectively .
In 1868 he published an Introduction to the New Testament .
He also published works on the Last Days of the Life of Jesus , on Judaism in the Time of Christ , on John of Damascus -LRB- 1879 -RRB- and an Examination of the Vatican Dogma in the Light of Patristic Exegesis of the New Testament .
But he is chiefly famous for his Geschichte der RÃ¶mischen Kirche -LRB- History of the Church of Rome to the Pontificate of Innocent III -RRB- -LRB- 4 vols , 1881-1893 -RRB- , a work of sound scholarship , based directly upon the authorities , the most important sources being woven carefully into the text .
He also contributed largely to the internationale theologische Zeitschrift , a review started in 1893 by the Old Catholics to promote the union of several National Churches on the basis of the councils of the Undivided Church , and admitting articles in German , French and English .
Among other subjects , he wrote on the School of Hierotheus , on Romish falsifications of the Greek Fathers , on Pope Leo XIII , on Liberal Ultramontanism , on the Papal Teaching in regard to Morals , on Vincent of Lerins and he carried on a controversy with Professor Willibald Beyschlag , of the German Evangelical Church , on the respective merits of Protestantism and Old Catholicism regarded as a basis for teaching the Christian faith .
An attack of apoplexy put an end to his teaching career and hastened his death .

Splitting maul
A splitting maul -LRB- or mall -RRB- is a heavy , long-handled hammer used for splitting a piece of wood along its grain .
One side of it is identical to a sledgehammer and the other side is an axe .
In parts of England the word denotes a tool with a very heavy wooden head , used for splitting wood in conjunction with a metal wedge .
This tool is also known as a beetle ; there is a well known pub on the River Thames at Moulsford called the Beetle and Wedge .
Wood splitting tools
A typical maul for wood splitting will have a head weighing in region of 4kg -LRB- 8lbs -RRB- .
Traditionally , mauls have a wedge -shaped head , but some modern versions have conical heads or swiveling sub-wedges .
The original maul resembles an axe but with a broader head .
For splitting wood , this tool is much better than a typical axe .
The weight of it is more advantageous and due to its width , it is less likely to become stuck in the wood .
The handles are typically made from hickory , though synthetic handles have become common , as they are more difficult to break .
Unlike an axe , maul handles are normally straight and closer to round than the oblonged axe handles tend to be .
In the early 1970s a triangular head design with an unbreakable metal handle was introduced called the `` Monster Maul . ''
Hydraulic log splitters are commonly used today .
They can be either horizontal or vertical as shown here .
Wood splitting techniques
Monster Maul
The maul is most commonly struck onto a flush-cut section of log , usually standing on end atop a splitting stump or other suitable base .
Most cut sections can be split in a single downward chop of the maul , splitting the wood apart along its grain .
Mauls regularly become stuck in the log for several reasons , such as the wood not being struck with adequate force , the wood containing hidden knots , or the length of wood being too long .
Unlike an axe , mauls are effective longer after the edge dulls , as the primary mechanism is that of a wedge pushed through along the wood grain , and not a cross-grain chop of an axe .
In some cases , longer logs may be split while they rest length-wise on the base or ground .
Mauls often become stuck in logs mid-split requiring a `` full-lift '' chop to be used .
This involves the chopper reswinging the maul , but this time lifting the half-split log while still attached to the embedded maul , often requiring one or two additional full-lift chops .
Another technique for splitting upright logs of thicker diameter is to land the maul 's full force off-center of the log , usually removing 1/4 of the mass of the log .
When repeated , large logs that would ordinarily cause the maul to be embedded on a center-strike can be handled easily .
Safety considerations
Hydraulic splitting machine
The hammer side of the maul is often used in wood splitting when combined with a splitting wedge , driving the wedge into the wood in the same fashion as the maul itself .
This is generally used when attempting to split logs with a large diameter .
Modern mauls are made of a strong enough steel to withstand the metal-to-metal contact without chipping .
However , it is still common for the wedge itself to chip off .
This can be dangerous as flying chips of steel could damage the eye .
This is also the easiest way to break a maul 's handle because the wedge is a very small target as opposed to the whole log , and can be overshot , resulting in the handle hitting full-force onto the wedge .
This greatly weakens the handle , and can cause it to break after only a few over-shots .
Harder seasoned logs which have dried sufficiently often split apart with enough force that each half tumbles away at some speed , which is a hazard for people or objects nearby .
A common danger for inexperienced splitters is to miss the upright log entirely or give it only a glancing blow .
If the maul lands beyond the log , the maul handle may either bounce or break .
If the maul lands in front of the log , it may hit the feet of the splitter if they are in a closed stance .
If the maul hits the side of the log without biting in , the maul commonly will bounce to one side and to the ground .
In this situation , even a widened stance may still leave the splitter 's feet vulnerable .
When performing the `` full-lift '' chop described above , the splitter must never raise the maul and log above his head .
Generally speaking , a maul should never swing to the side .
Rather it should be powered through the drop , using force to assist the natural weight of the maul .
In addition a suitable splitting base is one of the most important components to splitting wood with a maul .
Wood can be split directly off the ground , although this is a disadvantage for a few reasons .
For one the ground , if not frozen , will give on each blow , thereby weakening the overall effect of the blow .
The second disadvantage is that it can present the log to be split at a low level , forcing the person splitting the wood to bend over during the swing , which causes back fatigue .
The best bases are a flush-cut segments of logs , usually about one foot tall , and made of hard wood .
For repeated season use the top open grain may be treated slightly .
The diameter should be at least 100 per cent larger than that of the diameter of the wood placed atop it for splitting , and the base should be placed on firm ground .
Another technique to improve safety involves pinning the head of the maul to the handle .
Repeated use can loosen the head , and if the wedge or expander fails , the head will fly from the handle .
Placing a pin involves drilling a small diameter hole through the side of the maul , into and through the handle , and usually out the other side .
A small , flush , or counter-sunk pin of aluminum or similar material should be placed through the head and secured .
It is critical that the pin not protrude from the side of the maul head .

Holy Trinity Icon
Russian icon of the Old Testament Trinity by Andrey Rublev , between 1408-25
The Holy Trinity is an important subject of iconographic representation in Eastern Orthodox Christianity .
There are two different types of Holy Trinity icons : the Old Testament Trinity and the New Testament Trinity -LRB- Троица Ветхозаветная and Троица Новозаветная in Russian -RRB- .
Old Testament Trinity
The Old Testament Trinity subject is best known from the famous icon painted by St Andrey Rublev -LRB- created sometime between 1408 and 1425 -RRB- .
This icon is actually more properly called the `` Hospitality of Abraham '' -LRB- see Genesis 18 -RRB- .
The appearance of the three angels to Abraham at Mamre was a type of the Holy Trinity , not an appearance of the Holy Trinity itself .
There is only one hypostasis , the Divine Logos , Jesus Christ in the form of an angel and two angels .
New Testament Trinity
Greek Orthodox fresco of the `` New Testament Trinity ''
The New Testament Trinity , derived from Western models , and only appearing in Orthodox art after the Fall of Constantinople , depicts the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit distinctly .
The Father is painted as a white-bearded man with a very special type of nimbus -LRB- it contains two rombic figures : one is red , another is blue -RRB- .
The Holy Spirit is shown as a white dove with a halo of the same type as Father has .
The dove may be placed between the Father and the Son -LRB- if they sit near each other at the same level -RRB- , or the dove may be shown in a beam of light from the mouth of the Father , as if the Holy Spirit was just sent by Him .
Christ may be shown either as an adult , -LRB- in this case he is sitting right from His Father -RRB- or as an infant -LRB- in this case he is sitting on His Father 's knees -RRB- .
The name of this type of icon is also called Paternity .
It is interesting that in Russian Orthodoxy , depictions of God the Father are prohibited .
However , when the movement of antitrinitrarians became strong in medieval Novgorod , a new type of iconography appeared : Spas Vethiy Denmi -LRB- The Savior Old with Days -RRB- .
In this type of icon , Jesus Christ is depicted as an old white-haired man .
The basis of this iconography is that Jesus is saying that He and the Father are one .
This very image of God the Father is used in New Testament Trinity icons .
Nevertheless , according to the Synodic Act of the Seventh Ecumenical Synod , this icon remains heretical .
The Second Council of Nicea in 787 confirmed that the depiction of Christ was allowed because he became man ; the situation regarding the Father was less clear .
The usual Orthodox representation of the Trinity was through the `` Old Testament Trinity '' of the three angels visiting Abraham - said in the text to be `` the Lord '' -LRB- Genesis : 18.1-15 -RRB- .
However post-Byzantine representations similar to those in the West are not uncommon in the Greek world .
The subject long remained sensitive , and the Russian Orthodox Church at the Great Synod of Moscow in 1667 finally forbade depictions of the Father in human form , although other Orthodox churches may not follow this ruling .
The canon is quoted in full here because it explains the Russian Orthodox theology on the subject :
Chapter 2 , Â§44 : It is most absurd and improper to depict in icons the Lord Sabaoth -LRB- that is to say , God the Father -RRB- with a grey beard and the Only-Begotten Son in His bosom with a dove between them , because no-one has seen the Father according to His Divinity , and the Father has no flesh , nor was the Son born in the flesh from the Father before the ages .
And though David the prophet says , `` From the womb before the morning star have I begotten Thee '' -LRB- Ps.109 : 3 -RRB- , that birth was not fleshly , but unspeakable and incomprehensible .
For Christ Himself says in the holy Gospel , `` No man hath seen the Father , save the Son '' -LRB- cf. -RRB- .
And Isaiah the prophet says in his fortieth chapter : `` To whom have ye likened the Lord ?
and with what likeness have ye made a similitude of Him ?
Has not the artificier of wood made an image , or the goldsmiths , having melted gold , gilt it over , and made it a similitude ? ''
-LRB- -RRB- .
In like manner the Apostle Paul says in the Acts -LRB- -RRB- , `` Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone , graven by art of man 's imagination . ''
And John Damascene says : `` But furthermore , who can make a similitude of the invisible , incorporeal , uncircumscribed and undepictable God ?
It is , then , uttermost insanity and impiety to give a form to the Godhead '' -LRB- Orthodox Faith , 4 : 16 -RRB- .
In like manner St. Gregory the Dialogist prohibits this .
For this reason we should only form an understanding in the mind of Sabaoth , which is the Godhead , and of that birth before the ages of the Only-Begotten-Son from the Father , but we should never , in any wise depict these in icons , for this , indeed , is impossible .
And the Holy Spirit is not in essence a dove , but in essence he is God , and `` No man hath seen God '' , as John the Theologian and Evangelist bears witness -LRB- -RRB- and this is so even though , at the Jordan at Christ 's holy Baptism the Holy Spirit appeared in the likeness of a dove .
For this reason , it is fitting on this occasion only to depict the Holy Spirit in the likeness of a dove .
But in any other place those who have intelligence will not depict the Holy Spirit in the likeness of a dove .
For on Mount Tabor , He appeared as a cloud and , at another time , in other ways .
Furthermore , Sabaoth is the name not only of the Father , but of the Holy Trinity .
According to Dionysios the Areopagite , Lord Sabaoth , translated from the Jewish tongue , means `` Lord of Hosts '' .
This Lord of Hosts is the Holy Trinity , Father , Son and Holy Spirit .
And although Daniel the prophet says that he beheld the Ancient of Days sitting on a throne , this should not be understood to refer to the Father , but to the Son , Who at His second coming will judge every nation at the dreadful Judgment .
Modern Romanian icon of the Old Testament Trinity closely follows Rublev 's iconography
The New Testament Trinity subject may be actually introduced into any icon where the Christ is shown : for this purpose the painter needs only to add the Father and the dove at the upper side of the icon .
The New Testament Trinity is not popular in official Orthodoxy in Russia nowadays , though it was popular in Novgorod earlier .
Among Popovtsy Old Believers this type of an icon is very widespread , since the New Testament Trinity is depicted above any crucifixion icon -LRB- without the Son , since he is on the Cross in this case -RRB- .
The New Testament Trinity also appears on the wonder-working icon of Our Lady of Kursk -LRB- also without the Son , since in this case Mary holds him on her knees -RRB- .

Zwei kleine Italiener
`` Zwei kleine Italiener '' -LRB- `` Two little Italians '' -RRB- was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1962 , performed in German by Conny Froboess .
The song was performed seventh on the night , following Sweden ` s Inger Berggren with `` Sol och vÃ¥r `` and preceding the Netherlands ` De Spelbrekers with `` Katinka `` .
At the close of voting , it had received 9 points , placing 6th in a field of 16 .
The song -LRB- with lyrics by Georg Buschor and music by Christian Bruhn -RRB- is a moderately up-tempo number , with Froboess describing the plight of two gastarbeiters from Italy who wish to return to their homeland to be with their girlfriends , Tina and Marina .
She contrasts this situation with that of the rest of German society -LRB- at the time undergoing the Wirtschaftswunder largely as a result of immigrant labour -RRB- , for whom `` a journey to the South is something chic and fine '' .
The two Italians , it seems , despair of ever returning to Naples .
This unusual subject matter marks the first time that a social issue was described in a Contest entry .
Despite its middle-of-the-table finish , the song has become a minor favourite among Contest fans .
Froboess herself recorded versions of the song in English -LRB- as `` Gino '' -RRB- , Dutch -LRB- `` Twee kleine Italianen '' -RRB- and Italian -LRB- `` Un bacio all'italiana '' -RRB- .
Of these , only the Dutch version relates to the same topic .
The English version is a love song to a man named Gino , while the Italian version describes her preference for lovers from that country .
It was succeeded as German representative at the 1963 contest by Heidi BrÃ¼hl with `` Marcel `` .

Coventry, Connecticut
Coventry is a town in Tolland County , Connecticut , United States .
The population was 11,504 at the 2000 census .
The birthplace of Capt. Nathan Hale , Coventry is home to the Nathan Hale Homestead , which is now a museum open to the public .
Coventry was incorporated in May 1712 .
Geography
According to the United States Census Bureau , the town has a total area of 38.4 square miles -LRB- 99.4 km2 -RRB- , of which , 37.7 square miles -LRB- 97.7 km2 -RRB- of it is land and 0.6 square miles -LRB- 1.7 km2 -RRB- of it -LRB- 1.67 % -RRB- is water .
History
Coventry was named in October 1711 , the first town in the colonies to be named `` Coventry '' for Coventry , West Midlands , United Kingdom .
Settlement and founding
The first house in Coventry , CT was said to have been built near the shore of Lake Wangumbaug by Nathaniel Rust , a Hartford , CT man , originally of Northampton , Massachusetts .
The entire Rust family is said to have made their final move to Coventry from Massachusetts in a group of a dozen families in 1709 .
Along with Nathaniel Rust , the names of some of the earliest settlers were David Lee , Thomas Root , Samuel Gurley , Ebenezer Searl , Joseph Petty , Benjamin James and Benjamin Carpenter .
Four other settlers were also of Northampton , MA and two from Reading , MA .
URL_http
The land was said to have originally been given to men from Hartford by Joshua , Indian sachem .
The Connecticut General Assembly , held in Hartford in 1706 , appointed William Pitkin , Joseph Tallcot , William Whiting , and Richard Lord , as a committee with full power to lay out the bounds of the town and divisions of the land , to admit inhabitants .
A 1711 revision added Nathaniel Rust to the committee and the task of procuring a minister of the gospel .
URL_http The first church was established in October 1714 .
To the present
The old center of the town is in South Coventry , near the intersection of Route 31 -LRB- Main Street -RRB- and Route 275 -LRB- Stonehouse Road -RRB- .
In the 19th century , there was a small industrial center including mills powered by the water from Coventry Lake Brook as it flowed towards the Willimantic River .
South Coventry Village , listed on the National Register of Historic Places , also includes several Victorian houses , a museum , the main branch of the public library , and the Bidwell Tavern , a bar/restaurant established in 1822 .
A few doors down is the W.L Wellwood General Store , under new ownership , has been renamed `` Coventry Country Store '' .
The general store was originally built in 1787 making it one of , if not the oldest General Store in America -LRB- a past owner claimed to have not found an older store -RRB- .
In all , the area has over 100 historical buildings on the national register .
North Coventry 's settlement is less dense , and its housing and businesses are of more recent construction .
In the 18th century , this section of the town was largely used for dairy and vegetable farming .
As the United States expanded westward , many farming families left the rocky fields of Connecticut for the more fertile land of the Ohio River valley .
Most of the farms in North Coventry were abandoned , and the land reclaimed by second-growth forest .
In the 1960s and 1970s , tract housing developments were built on some of this land , mainly raised ranch or split-level houses on one acre -LRB- 4,000 m2 -RRB- lots .
Development slowed from the mid-1970s through the 1990s , but several new developments were constructed in North Coventry after 1990 .
These tend to feature larger houses on two acre -LRB- 8,000 m2 -RRB- lots .
